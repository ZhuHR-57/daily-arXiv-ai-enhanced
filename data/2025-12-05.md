Abstract: Web privacy is experienced via two public artifacts: site utterances in policy texts, and the actions users are required to take during consent interfaces. In the extensive cross-section audits we've studied, there is a lack of longitudinal data detailing how these artifacts are changing together, and if interfaces are actually doing what they promise in policy. ConsentDiff provides that longitudinal view. We build a reproducible pipeline that snapshots sites every month, semantically aligns policy clauses to track clause-level churn, and classifies consent-UI patterns by pulling together DOM signals with cues provided by screenshots. We introduce a novel weighted claim-UI alignment score, connecting common policy claims to observable predicates, and enabling comparisons over time, regions, and verticals. Our measurements suggest continued policy churn, systematic changes to eliminate a higher-friction banner design, and significantly higher alignment where rejecting is visible and lower friction.

Abstract: Developing human-controllable artificial intelligence (AI) and achieving meaningful human control (MHC) has become a vital principle to address these challenges, ensuring ethical alignment and effective governance in AI. MHC is also a critical focus in human-centered AI (HCAI) research and application. This chapter systematically examines MHC in AI, articulating its foundational principles and future trajectory. MHC is not simply the right to operate, but the unity of human understanding, intervention, and the traceablity of responsibility in AI decision-making, which requires technological design, AI governance, and humans to play a role together. MHC ensures AI autonomy serves humans without constraining technological progress. The mode of human control needs to match the levels of technology, and human supervision should balance the trust and doubt of AI. For future AI systems, MHC mandates human controllability as a prerequisite, requiring: (1) technical architectures with embedded mechanisms for human control; (2) human-AI interactions optimized for better access to human understanding; and (3) the evolution of AI systems harmonizing intelligence and human controllability. Governance must prioritize HCAI strategies: policies balancing innovation and risk mitigation, human-centered participatory frameworks transcending technical elite dominance, and global promotion of MHC as a universal governance paradigm to safeguard HCAI development. Looking ahead, there is a need to strengthen interdisciplinary research on the controllability of AI systems, enhance ethical and legal awareness among stakeholders, moving beyond simplistic technology design perspectives, focus on the knowledge construction, complexity interpretation, and influencing factors surrounding human control. By fostering MHC, the development of human-controllable AI can be further advanced, delivering HCAI systems.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: What is after presence? Spatial presence, the sense of "being there", is becoming less of a primary objective and more of a baseline expectation of virtual reality. More than six decades after its invention, VR is shifting from a technical system into a cultural, social, and phenomenological medium, offering experiences that function as distinct modes of reality. Existing theories that focus primarily on perceptual illusions are no longer sufficient to account for these emerging forms of experience. A new framework is needed to guide the design and evaluation of immersive environments by identifying the key technical and abstract dimensions afforded by virtual worlds. These dimensions include spatial, placeness, temporal, social, cultural, cognitive, and psychological parameters. The central argument is that immersive environments must move beyond the technical dimension to leverage richer information channels that shape user experience. This shift from presence to experience orchestration invites creators across disciplines to contribute to the design and assessment of meaningful immersive worlds.

Abstract: Interactive communication (IC), i.e., the reciprocal exchange of in- formation between two or more interactive partners, is a fundamental part of human nature. As such, it has been studied across multiple scientific disciplines with different goals and methods. This article pro- vides a cross-disciplinary primer on contemporary IC that integrates psy- chological mechanisms with acoustic and media-technological constraints across theory, measurement, and applications. First, we outline theoreti- cal frameworks that account for verbal, nonverbal and multimodal aspects of IC, including distinctions between face-to-face and computer-mediated communication. Second, we summarize key methodological approaches, including behavioral, cognitive, and experiential measures of communica- tive synchrony and acoustic signal quality. Third, we discuss selected applications, i.e. assistive listening technologies, conversational agents, alongside ethical considerations. Taken together, this review highlights how human capacities and technical systems jointly shape IC, consolidat- ing concepts, findings, and challenges that have often been discussed in separate lines of research.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Generative AI systems may pose serious risks to individuals vulnerable to eating disorders. Existing safeguards tend to overlook subtle but clinically significant cues, leaving many risks unaddressed. To better understand the nature of these risks, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 15 clinicians, researchers, and advocates with expertise in eating disorders. Using abductive qualitative analysis, we developed an expert-guided taxonomy of generative AI risks across seven categories: (1) providing generalized health advice; (2) encouraging disordered behaviors; (3) supporting symptom concealment; (4) creating thinspiration; (5) reinforcing negative self-beliefs; (6) promoting excessive focus on the body; and (7) perpetuating narrow views about eating disorders. Our results demonstrate how certain user interactions with generative AI systems intersect with clinical features of eating disorders in ways that may intensify risk. We discuss implications of our work, including approaches for risk assessment, safeguard design, and participatory evaluation practices with domain experts.

Abstract: Web accessibility guidelines require sufficient color contrast between text and backgrounds; yet, manually adjusting colors often necessitates significant visual deviation, compromising vital brand aesthetics. We present a novel, multi-phase optimization approach for automatically generating WCAG-compliant colors while minimizing perceptual change to original design choices.
  Our method treats this as a constrained, non-linear optimization problem, utilizing the modern perceptually uniform OKLCH color space. Crucially, the optimization is constrained to preserve the original hue ($\text{H}$) of the color, ensuring that modifications are strictly limited to necessary adjustments in lightness ($\text{L}$) and chroma ($\text{C}$). This is achieved through a three-phase sequence: binary search, gradient descent, and progressive constraint relaxation.
  Evaluation on a dataset of 10,000 procedurally generated color pairs demonstrates that the algorithm successfully resolves accessibility violations in $77.22\%$ of cases, with $88.51\%$ of successful corrections exhibiting imperceptible color difference ($ΔE_{2000} < 2.0$) as defined by standard perceptibility thresholds. The median perceptual change for successful adjustments is only $0.76\ ΔE_{2000}$, and the algorithm achieves this with a median processing time of $0.876\text{ms}$ per color pair.
  The approach demonstrates that accessibility compliance and visual design integrity can be achieved simultaneously through a computationally efficient, perceptually-aware optimization that respects brand identity. The algorithm is publicly implemented in the open-source cm-colors Python library.

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for adaptive traffic signal control (ATSC) of multiple intersections. Existing approaches typically follow either a fully centralized or a fully decentralized design. Fully centralized approaches suffer from the curse of dimensionality, and reliance on a single learning server, whereas purely decentralized approaches operate under severe partial observability and lack explicit coordination resulting in suboptimal performance. These limitations motivate region-based MARL, where the network is partitioned into smaller, tightly coupled intersections that form regions, and training is organized around these regions. This paper introduces a Semi-Centralized Training, Decentralized Execution (SEMI-CTDE) architecture for multi intersection ATSC. Within each region, SEMI-CTDE performs centralized training with regional parameter sharing and employs composite state and reward formulations that jointly encode local and regional information. The architecture is highly transferable across different policy backbones and state-reward instantiations. Building on this architecture, we implement two models with distinct design objectives. A multi-perspective experimental analysis of the two implemented SEMI-CTDE-based models covering ablations of the architecture's core elements including rule based and fully decentralized baselines shows that they achieve consistently superior performance and remain effective across a wide range of traffic densities and distributions.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: This article extends the preprint "Characterizing Agent-Based Model Dynamics via $ε$-Machines and Kolmogorov-Style Complexity" by introducing diffusion models as orthogonal and complementary tools for characterizing the output of agent-based models (ABMs). Where $ε$-machines capture the predictive temporal structure and intrinsic computation of ABM-generated time series, diffusion models characterize high-dimensional cross-sectional distributions, learn underlying data manifolds, and enable synthetic generation of plausible population-level outcomes. We provide a formal analysis demonstrating that the two approaches operate on distinct mathematical domains -processes vs.\ distributions- and show that their combination yields a two-axis representation of ABM behavior based on temporal organization and distributional geometry. To our knowledge, this is the first framework to integrate computational mechanics with score-based generative modeling for the structural analysis of ABM outputs, thereby situating ABM characterization within the broader landscape of modern machine-learning methods for density estimation and intrinsic computation. The framework is validated using the same elder-caregiver ABM dataset introduced in the companion paper, and we provide precise definitions and propositions formalizing the mathematical complementarity between $ε$-machines and diffusion models. This establishes a principled methodology for jointly analyzing temporal predictability and high-dimensional distributional structure in complex simulation models.

Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) agents are deployed across economic domains, understanding their strategic behavior and market-level impact becomes critical. This paper puts forward a groundbreaking new framework that is the first to capture the real-world economic forces that shape agentic labor markets: adverse selection, moral hazard, and reputation dynamics. Our framework encapsulates three core capabilities that successful LLM-agents will need: \textbf{metacognition} (accurate self-assessment of skills), \textbf{competitive awareness} (modeling rivals and market dynamics), and \textbf{long-horizon strategic planning}. We illustrate our framework through a tractable simulated gig economy where agentic Large Language Models (LLMs) compete for jobs, develop skills, and adapt their strategies under competitive pressure. Our simulations illustrate how LLM agents explicitly prompted with reasoning capabilities learn to strategically self-improve and demonstrate superior adaptability to changing market conditions. At the market level, our simulations reproduce classic macroeconomic phenomena found in human labor markets, while controlled experiments reveal potential AI-driven economic trends, such as rapid monopolization and systemic price deflation. This work provides a foundation to further explore the economic properties of AI-driven labour markets, and a conceptual framework to study the strategic reasoning capabilities in agents competing in the emerging economy.

Abstract: The future of digital marketing lies in the convergence of human creativity and generative AI, where insight, strategy, and storytelling are co-authored by intelligent systems. We present MindFuse, a brave new explainable generative AI framework designed to act as a strategic partner in the marketing process. Unlike conventional LLM applications that stop at content generation, MindFuse fuses CTR-based content AI-guided co-creation with large language models to extract, interpret, and iterate on communication narratives grounded in real advertising data. MindFuse operates across the full marketing lifecycle: from distilling content pillars and customer personas from competitor campaigns to recommending in-flight optimizations based on live performance telemetry. It uses attention-based explainability to diagnose ad effectiveness and guide content iteration, while aligning messaging with strategic goals through dynamic narrative construction and storytelling. We introduce a new paradigm in GenAI for marketing, where LLMs not only generate content but reason through it, adapt campaigns in real time, and learn from audience engagement patterns. Our results, validated in agency deployments, demonstrate up to 12 times efficiency gains, setting the stage for future integration with empirical audience data (e.g., GWI, Nielsen) and full-funnel attribution modeling. MindFuse redefines AI not just as a tool, but as a collaborative agent in the creative and strategic fabric of modern marketing.

Abstract: Neural implicit representations of 3D shapes have shown great potential in 3D shape editing due to their ability to model high-level semantics and continuous geometric representations. However, existing methods often suffer from limited editability, lack of part-level control, and unnatural results when modifying or rearranging shape parts. In this work, we present SPLICE, a novel part-level neural implicit representation of 3D shapes that enables intuitive, structure-aware, and high-fidelity shape editing. By encoding each shape part independently and positioning them using parameterized Gaussian ellipsoids, SPLICE effectively isolates part-specific features while discarding global context that may hinder flexible manipulation. A global attention-based decoder is then employed to integrate parts coherently, further enhanced by an attention-guiding filtering mechanism that prevents information leakage across symmetric or adjacent components. Through this architecture, SPLICE supports various part-level editing operations, including translation, rotation, scaling, deletion, duplication, and cross-shape part mixing. These operations enable users to flexibly explore design variations while preserving semantic consistency and maintaining structural plausibility. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SPLICE outperforms existing approaches both qualitatively and quantitatively across a diverse set of shape-editing tasks.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Image convolution with complex kernels is a fundamental operation in photography, scientific imaging, and animation effects, yet direct dense convolution is computationally prohibitive on resource-limited devices. Existing approximations, such as simulated annealing or low-rank decompositions, either lack efficiency or fail to capture non-convex kernels. We introduce a differentiable kernel decomposition framework that represents a target spatially-variant, dense, complex kernel using a set of sparse kernel samples. Our approach features (i) a decomposition that enables differentiable optimization of sparse kernels, (ii) a dedicated initialization strategy for non-convex shapes to avoid poor local minima, and (iii) a kernel-space interpolation scheme that extends single-kernel filtering to spatially varying filtering without retraining and additional runtime overhead. Experiments on Gaussian and non-convex kernels show that our method achieves higher fidelity than simulated annealing and significantly lower cost than low-rank decompositions. Our approach provides a practical solution for mobile imaging and real-time rendering, while remaining fully differentiable for integration into broader learning pipelines.
