We introduce Explorable Ideas, a framework that externalizes abstract concepts into explorable environments where physical navigation coordinates conceptual exploration. To investigate its practical value, we designed Idea Islands, a VR probe for ideation tasks, and conducted two controlled studies with 19 participants. Results show that overview perspectives foster strategic breadth while immersion sustains engagement through embodied presence, and that seamless transitions enable flexible workflows combining both modes. These findings validate the framework's design considerations and yield design implications for building future systems that treat information as explorable territory across creative, educational, and knowledge-intensive domains."}

Most bot-detection systems still treat behavioural features as static, implicitly assuming bots behave stationarily over time. We test that assumption for promotional Twitter bots, analysing change in both individual behavioural signals and the relationships between them. Using 2,615 promotional bot accounts and 2.8M tweets, we build yearly time series for ten content-based meta-features. Augmented Dickey-Fuller and KPSS tests plus linear trends show all ten are non-stationary: nine increase over time, while language diversity declines slightly.\n  Stratifying by activation generation and account age reveals systematic differences: second-generation bots are most active and link-heavy; short-lived bots show intense, repetitive activity with heavy hashtag/URL use; long-lived bots are less active but more linguistically diverse and use emojis more variably. We then analyse co-occurrence across generations using 18 interpretable binary features spanning actions, topic similarity, URLs, hashtags, sentiment, emojis, and media (153 pairs). Chi-square tests indicate almost all pairs are dependent. Spearman correlations shift in strength and sometimes polarity: many links (e.g. multiple hashtags with media; sentiment with URLs) strengthen, while others flip from weakly positive to weakly or moderately negative. Later generations show more structured combinations of cues.\n  Taken together, these studies provide evidence that promotional social bots adapt over time at both the level of individual meta-features and the level of feature interdependencies, with direct implications for the design and evaluation of bot-detection systems trained on historical behavioural features."}

Virtual reality (VR) can present these practices and services in situated, interactive form, yet its role in service design for plastics recycling is still emerging. This paper examines how VR tools can contribute to designing plastics recycling services through two application cases that address different stages of the recycling journey. The first case, Clean Cabin Escape, is a household scale VR escape room where players collect and sort waste items into locally relevant categories, with immediate feedback that supports practice with plastics recycling decisions. The second case is a VR simulation of a plastics recycling center that represents a real planned site and is used in service design workshops where stakeholders explore layout, signage and customer paths for plastics fractions. Across the cases, we analyse how VR supported learning, engagement and shared sensemaking, and how it interacted with other service design methods such as workshops, customer path mapping and physical artefacts. The findings show that VR can make domestic sorting tasks and complex recycling centers more concrete for both citizens and professionals, but also highlight trade offs related to hardware access, onboarding effort, visual fidelity and localisation of recycling rules. The paper concludes by outlining opportunities for integrating VR into broader service design toolsets for plastics recycling and circular economy services, and by pointing to directions for future research on long term impact and inclusive design."}

This includes fields such as social, political, and psychological research, where the goal is to model group dynamics and social behavior. However, current LLM agents often lack the psychological depth and consistency needed to capture the real patterns of human thinking. They usually provide direct or statistically likely answers, but they miss the deeper goals, emotional conflicts, and motivations that drive real human interactions. This paper proposes a Multi-Agent System (MAS) inspired by Transactional Analysis (TA) theory. In the proposed system, each agent is divided into three ego states - Parent, Adult, and Child. The ego states are treated as separate knowledge structures with their own perspectives and reasoning styles. To enrich their response process, they have access to an information retrieval mechanism that allows them to retrieve relevant contextual information from their vector stores. This architecture is evaluated through ablation tests in a simulated dialogue scenario, comparing agents with and without information retrieval. The results are promising and open up new directions for exploring how psychologically grounded structures can enrich agent behavior. The contribution is an agent architecture that integrates Transactional Analysis theory with contextual information retrieval to enhance the realism of LLM-based multi-agent simulations."}

In this paper, we propose Voxel-GS, a simple yet highly effective framework that departs from the complex neural entropy models of prior work, instead achieving competitive performance using only a lightweight rate proxy and run-length coding. Specifically, we employ a differentiable quantization to discretize the Gaussian attributes of Scaffold-GS. Subsequently, a Laplacian-based rate proxy is devised to impose an entropy constraint, guiding the generation of high-fidelity and compact reconstructions. Finally, this integer-type Gaussian point cloud is compressed losslessly using Octree and run-length coding. Experiments validate that the proposed rate proxy accurately estimates the bitrate of run-length coding, enabling Voxel-GS to eliminate redundancy and optimize for a more compact representation. Consequently, our method achieves a remarkable compression ratio with significantly faster coding speeds than prior art. The code is available at https://github.com/zb12138/VoxelGS."}

Ising machines implemented using dynamical, digital and compute-in-memory (CiM) approaches offer a promising alternative, but often suffer from poor initialization and a fundamental trade-off between algorithmic performance and hardware efficiency. Hardware-friendly schemes such as simulated annealing converge slowly, whereas faster algorithms, including simulated bifurcation, are difficult to implement efficiently in CiM hardware, limiting both convergence speed and solution quality. To address these limitations, here we present a ferroelectric field-effect transistor (FeFET)-based CiM Ising framework that tightly co-designs algorithms and hardware to efficiently solve large-scale combinatorial optimization problems. The proposed approach employs a two-step algorithmic flow: an attention-inspired initialization that exploits global spin topology and reduces the required iterations by up to 80%, followed by a lightweight simulated bifurcation algorithm specifically tailored for CiM implementation. To natively accelerate the core vector-matrix and vector-matrix-vector operations in both steps, we fabricate a 32x256 FeFET CiM chip using ferroelectric capacitors integrated at the back end of line of a 180-nm CMOS platform. Across Max-Cut instances with up to 100,000 nodes, the proposed hardware-software co-designed solver achieves up to a 175.9x speedup over a GPU-based simulated bifurcation implementation while consistently delivering superior solution quality."}

This study investigates how emotional alignment, semantic exploration, and linguistic innovation emerge within a collaborative storytelling paradigm that paired human participants with a large language model (LLM) in a turn-taking setup. Over nine days, more than 3,000 museum visitors contributed to 27 evolving narratives, co-authored with an LLM in a naturalistic, public installation. To isolate the dynamics specific to human involvement, we compared the resulting dataset with a simulated baseline where two LLMs completed the same task. Using sentiment analysis, semantic embeddings, and information-theoretic measures of novelty and resonance, we trace how humans and models co-construct stories over time. Our results reveal that affective alignment is primarily driven by the model, with limited mutual convergence in human-AI interaction. At the same time, human participants explored a broader semantic space and introduced more novel, narratively influential contributions. These patterns were significantly reduced in the simulated AI-AI condition. Together, these findings highlight the unique role of human input in shaping narrative direction and creative divergence in co-authored texts. The methods developed here provide a scalable framework for analysing dyadic interaction and offer a new lens on creativity, emotional dynamics, and semantic coordination in human-AI collaboration."}

Most existing studies rely on evolutionary update rules or value-based reinforcement learning methods. These approaches struggle to represent payoff coupling and non-stationarity in large interacting populations. This work introduces Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (MAPPO) into spatial public goods games for the first time. In these games, individual returns are intrinsically coupled through overlapping group interactions. Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) treats agents as independent learners and ignores this coupling during value estimation. MAPPO addresses this limitation through a centralized critic that evaluates joint strategy configurations. To study neighborhood-level cooperation signals under this framework, we propose MAPPO with Local Cooperation Reward, termed MAPPO-LCR. The local cooperation reward aligns policy updates with surrounding cooperative density without altering the original game structure. MAPPO-LCR preserves decentralized execution while enabling population-level value estimation during training. Extensive simulations demonstrate stable cooperation emergence and reliable convergence across enhancement factors. Statistical analyses further confirm the learning advantage of MAPPO over PPO in spatial public goods games."}

Operating under the KĀ'EO AI Policy Framework, the workflow used NotebookLM for cross-document synthesis of psychometric data and Claude 3.5 Sonnet for developer-facing interpretation, with human oversight at every stage. Fifty-eight flagged items across Hawaiian Language Arts, Mathematics, and Science were reviewed during Round 2 of the AI Lab, producing six interpretive briefs that identified systemic design issues such as linguistic ambiguity, Depth-of-Knowledge (DOK) misalignment, and structural overload. The findings demonstrate that AI can serve as an ethically bounded amplifier of human expertise, accelerating analysis while simultaneously prioritizing fairness, human expertise, and cultural authority.

The method first represents user interaction sequences on the interface by integrating dwell duration, click frequency, scrolling behavior, and contextual features, which are mapped into a unified latent space through embedding and positional encoding. On this basis, a multi-head self-attention mechanism is employed to capture long-range dependencies, while a feed-forward network performs deep nonlinear transformations to model the dynamic patterns of dwell time. Multiple comparative experiments are conducted with BILSTM, DRFormer, FedFormer, and iTransformer as baselines under the same conditions. The results show that the proposed method achieves the best performance in terms of MSE, RMSE, MAPE, and RMAE, and more accurately captures the complex patterns in interaction behavior. In addition, sensitivity experiments are carried out on hyperparameters and environments to examine the impact of the number of attention heads, sequence window length, and device environment on prediction performance, which further demonstrates the robustness and adaptability of the method.

Traditional explainable AI (XAI) methods, which often rely on feature-based or example-based explanations, struggle to deliver dynamic, context-specific, personalized, and human-centric insights for everyday AR users. These methods typically address separate explainability dimensions (e.g., when, what, how) with different explanation techniques, resulting in unrealistic and fragmented experiences for seamless AR interactions. To address this challenge, we propose PILAR, a novel framework that leverages a pre-trained large language model (LLM) to generate context-aware, personalized explanations, offering a more intuitive and trustworthy experience in real-time AI-powered AR systems. Unlike traditional methods, which rely on multiple techniques for different aspects of explanation, PILAR employs a unified LLM-based approach that dynamically adapts explanations to the user's needs, fostering greater trust and engagement. We implement the PILAR concept in a real-world AR application (e.g., personalized recipe recommendations), an open-source prototype that integrates real-time object detection, recipe recommendation, and LLM-based personalized explanations of the recommended recipes based on users' dietary preferences. We evaluate the effectiveness of PILAR through a user study with 16 participants performing AR-based recipe recommendation tasks, comparing an LLM-based explanation interface to a traditional template-based one. Results show that the LLM-based interface significantly enhances user performance and experience, with participants completing tasks 40% faster and reporting greater satisfaction, ease of use, and perceived transparency."}

A narrative review approach synthesizes empirical findings and derives research questions and hypotheses for future studies. The paper highlights that trust in AI is a psychological process shaped by individual differences and learning environments, with practical implications for instructors, administrators, and designers of educational AI systems."}

Adaptive systems are essential, dynamically matching difficulty to user ability to maintain engagement and accelerate learning. Current adaptive systems often rely on simple performance heuristics or predict visual complexity and affect instead of cognitive load. This study presents the first implementation of real-time adaptive cognitive load control in Virtual Reality cognitive training based on eye-tracking and physiological data. We developed a bidirectional LSTM model with a self-attention mechanism, trained on eye-tracking and physiological (PPG, GSR) data from 74 participants. We deployed it in real-time with 54 participants across single-task (sustained attention) and dual-task (sustained attention + mental arithmetic) paradigms. Difficulty was adjusted dynamically based on participant self-assessment or model's real-time cognitive load predictions. Participants showed a tendency to estimate the task as too difficult, even though they were objectively performing at their best. Over the course of a 10-minute session, both adaptation methods converged at equivalent difficulty in single-task scenarios, with no significant differences in subjective workload or game performance. However, in the dual-task conditions, the model successfully pushed users to higher difficulty levels without performance penalties or increased frustration, highlighting a user tendency to underestimate capacity under high cognitive load. Findings indicate that machine learning models may provide more objective cognitive capacity assessments than self-directed approaches, mitigating subjective performance biases and enabling more effective training by pushing users beyond subjective comfort zones toward physiologically-determined optimal challenge levels."}

Filmmakers often find that clips fail to match characters and backgrounds, making it difficult to build coherent sequences. A formative study with filmmakers highlighted challenges in shot composition, character motion, and camera control. We present Map2Video, a street view imagery-driven AI video generation tool grounded in real-world geographies. The system integrates Unity and ComfyUI with the VACE video generation model, as well as OpenStreetMap and Mapillary for street view imagery. Drawing on familiar filmmaking practices such as location scouting and rehearsal, Map2Video enables users to choose map locations, position actors and cameras in street view imagery, sketch movement paths, refine camera motion, and generate spatially consistent videos. We evaluated Map2Video with 12 filmmakers. Compared to an image-to-video baseline, it achieved higher spatial accuracy, required less cognitive effort, and offered stronger controllability for both scene replication and open-ended creative exploration."}

However, these systems can fail in opaque ways, making it difficult for users to observe, understand, and correct errors. We conducted formative interviews with 12 practitioners to identify mismatches between existing observability tools and users' needs. Based on these insights, we designed XAgen, an explainability tool that supports users with varying AI expertise through three core capabilities: log visualization for glanceable workflow understanding, human-in-the-loop feedback to capture expert judgment, and automatic error detection via an LLM-as-a-judge. In a user study with 8 participants, XAgen helped users more easily locate failures, attribute to specific agents or steps, and iteratively improve configurations. Our findings surface human-centered design guidelines for explainable agentic AI development and highlights opportunities for more context-aware interactive debugging."}
