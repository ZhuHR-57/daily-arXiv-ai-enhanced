Assume-guarantee reasoning can be of great help here, providing a way to decompose the complex problem into a small set of easier subproblems.\n  In this paper, we propose several schemes for assume-guarantee verification of probabilistic alternating-time temporal logic with imperfect information. We prove the soundness of the schemes, and discuss their completeness. On the way, we also propose a new variant of (non-probabilistic) alternating-time logic, where the strategic modalities capture \"achieving at most $\\varphi$,\" analogous to Levesque's logic of \"only knowing.\"", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Evaluation-Aligned Training Signals for Multi-LLM Agents", "comment": null, "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) in multi-agent systems (MAS) have shown promise for complex tasks, yet current training methods lack principled ways to connect system-level evaluation with agent-level and message-level learning. We propose a theoretical framework that unifies cooperative game-theoretic attribution with process reward modeling to transform system evaluation into agent credit and then into response-level signals. Unlike prior approaches that rely only on attribution (e.g., Shapley) or step-level labels (e.g., PRM), our method produces local, signed, and credit-conserving signals. In success cases, Shapley-based credit assignment fairly allocates outcomes across agents and is refined into per-message rewards that promote cooperation while discouraging redundancy or sabotage. In failure cases, first-error localization yields repair-aware preferences that penalize harmful steps while rewarding corrective attempts. The resulting signals are bounded, cooperative, and directly compatible with reinforcement-based or preference-based post-training, providing a unified and auditable pathway from global evaluation to local supervision in LLM multi-agent training. Our contribution is conceptual: we present a theoretical foundation and training signals, leaving empirical validation for future work.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}
