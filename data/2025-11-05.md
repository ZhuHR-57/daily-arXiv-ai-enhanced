Abstract: When several individuals collaborate on a shared task, their brain activities
often synchronize. This phenomenon, known as Inter-brain Synchronization (IBS),
is notable for inducing prosocial outcomes such as enhanced interpersonal
feelings, including closeness, trust, empathy, and more. Further strengthening
the IBS with the aid of external feedback would be beneficial for scenarios
where those prosocial feelings play a vital role in interpersonal
communication, such as rehabilitation between a therapist and a patient, motor
skill learning between a teacher and a student, and group performance art. This
paper investigates whether visual, auditory, and haptic feedback of the IBS
level can further enhance its intensity, offering design recommendations for
feedback systems in IBS. We report findings when three different types of
feedback were provided: IBS level feedback by means of on-body projection
mapping, sonification using chords, and vibration bands attached to the wrist.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Designing multi-functional alloys requires exploring high-dimensional
composition-structure-property spaces, yet current tools are limited to
low-dimensional projections and offer limited support for sensitivity or
multi-objective tradeoff reasoning. We introduce AlloyLens, an interactive
visual analytics system combining a coordinated scatterplot matrix (SPLOM),
dynamic parameter sliders, gradient-based sensitivity curves, and nearest
neighbor recommendations. This integrated approach reveals latent structure in
simulation data, exposes the local impact of compositional changes, and
highlights tradeoffs when exact matches are absent. We validate the system
through case studies co-developed with domain experts spanning structural,
thermal, and electrical alloy design.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Laparoscopic surgery constrains surgeons spatial awareness because procedures
are performed through a monocular, two-dimensional (2D) endoscopic view.
Conventional training methods using dry-lab models or recorded videos provide
limited depth cues, often leading trainees to misjudge instrument position and
perform ineffective or unsafe maneuvers. To address this limitation, we present
an AI-assisted training framework developed in NVIDIA Isaac Sim that couples
the standard 2D laparoscopic feed with synchronized three-dimensional (3D)
visual feedback delivered through a mixed-reality (MR) interface. While
trainees operate using the clinical 2D view, validated AI modules continuously
localize surgical instruments and detect instrument-tissue interactions in the
background. When spatial misjudgments are detected, 3D visual feedback are
displayed to trainees, while preserving the original operative perspective. Our
framework considers various surgical tasks including navigation, manipulation,
transfer, cutting, and suturing. Visually similar 2D cases can be disambiguated
through the added 3D context, improving depth perception, contact awareness,
and tool orientation understanding.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The proliferation of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) introduces profound
privacy risks from personal videos. This paper addresses the critical yet
unexplored inferential privacy threat, the risk of inferring sensitive personal
attributes over the data. To address this gap, we crowdsourced a dataset of 508
everyday personal videos from 58 individuals. We then conducted a benchmark
study evaluating VLM inference capabilities against human performance. Our
findings reveal three critical insights: (1) VLMs possess superhuman
inferential capabilities, significantly outperforming human evaluators,
leveraging a shift from object recognition to behavioral inference from
temporal streams. (2) Inferential risk is strongly correlated with factors such
as video characteristics and prompting strategies. (3) VLM-driven explanation
towards the inference is unreliable, as we revealed a disconnect between the
model-generated explanations and evidential impact, identifying ubiquitous
objects as misleading confounders.

Abstract: AI-generated content is rapidly becoming a salient component of online
information ecosystems, yet its influence on public trust and epistemic
judgments remains poorly understood. We present a large-scale mixed-design
experiment (N = 1,000) investigating how AI-generated credibility scores affect
user perception of political news. Our results reveal that AI feedback
significantly moderates partisan bias and institutional distrust, surpassing
traditional engagement signals such as likes and shares. These findings
demonstrate the persuasive power of generative AI and suggest a need for design
strategies that balance epistemic influence with user autonomy.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Adherence to healthy diets reduces chronic illness risk, yet rates remain
low. Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used for health
communication but often struggle to engage individuals with ambivalent
intentions at a pivotal stage of the Transtheoretical Model (TTM). We developed
CounselLLM, an open-source model enhanced through persona design and few-shot,
domain-specific prompts grounded in TTM and Motivational Interviewing (MI). In
controlled evaluations, CounselLLM showed stronger use of TTM subprocesses and
MI affirmations than human counselors, with comparable linguistic robustness
but expressed in more concrete terms. A user study then tested CounselLLM in an
interactive counseling setting against a baseline system. While knowledge and
perceptions did not change, participants' intentions for immediate dietary
change increased significantly after interacting with CounselLLM. Participants
also rated it as easy to use, understandable, and supportive. These findings
suggest theory-driven LLMs can effectively engage ambivalent individuals and
provide a scalable approach to digital counseling.

Abstract: Although the platform gig economy has reshaped the landscape of work, its
centralized operation by select actors has brought about challenges that
impedes workers' well-being. We present the architecture and design of
OpenCourier, an open protocol that defines communication patterns within a
decentralized ecosystem of delivery platforms. Through this protocol, we aim to
address three key challenges in the current economy: power imbalances between
the platform and workers, information asymmetries caused by black-boxed
algorithms and value misalignments in the infrastructure design process. With
the OpenCourier protocol, we outline a blueprint for community-owned ecosystem
of delivery platforms that centers worker agency, transparency, and bottom-up
design.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Mobile eye tracking plays a vital role in capturing human visual attention
across both real-world and extended reality (XR) environments, making it an
essential tool for applications ranging from behavioural research to
human-computer interaction. However, missing values due to blinks, pupil
detection errors, or illumination changes pose significant challenges for
further gaze data analysis. To address this challenge, we introduce HAGI++ - a
multi-modal diffusion-based approach for gaze data imputation that, for the
first time, uses the integrated head orientation sensors to exploit the
inherent correlation between head and eye movements. HAGI++ employs a
transformer-based diffusion model to learn cross-modal dependencies between eye
and head representations and can be readily extended to incorporate additional
body movements. Extensive evaluations on the large-scale Nymeria, Ego-Exo4D,
and HOT3D datasets demonstrate that HAGI++ consistently outperforms
conventional interpolation methods and deep learning-based time-series
imputation baselines in gaze imputation. Furthermore, statistical analyses
confirm that HAGI++ produces gaze velocity distributions that closely match
actual human gaze behaviour, ensuring more realistic gaze imputations.
Moreover, by incorporating wrist motion captured from commercial wearable
devices, HAGI++ surpasses prior methods that rely on full-body motion capture
in the extreme case of 100% missing gaze data (pure gaze generation). Our
method paves the way for more complete and accurate eye gaze recordings in
real-world settings and has significant potential for enhancing gaze-based
analysis and interaction across various application domains.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Developer communities increasingly rely on emoji reactions to communicate,
but we know little about how these emotional signals spread and influence
technical discussions. We analyzed 2,098 GitHub issues and pull requests across
50 popular repositories, examining patterns in 106,743 emoji reactions to
understand emotional contagion in software development. Our findings reveal a
surprisingly positive emotional landscape: 57.4% of discussions carry positive
sentiment, with positive emotional cascades outnumbering negative ones 23:1. We
identified five distinct patterns, with "instant enthusiasm" affecting 45.6% of
items--nearly half receive immediate positive reinforcement. Statistical
analysis confirms strong emotional contagion (r=0.679, p<0.001) with a massive
effect size (d=2.393), suggesting that initial reactions powerfully shape
discussion trajectories. These findings challenge assumptions about technical
discourse being purely rational, demonstrating that even minimal emotional
signals create measurable ripple effects. Our work provides empirical evidence
that emoji reactions are not mere decoration but active forces shaping
collaborative outcomes in software development.

Abstract: We introduce SigmaCollab, a dataset enabling research on physically situated
human-AI collaboration. The dataset consists of a set of 85 sessions in which
untrained participants were guided by a mixed-reality assistive AI agent in
performing procedural tasks in the physical world. SigmaCollab includes a set
of rich, multimodal data streams, such as the participant and system audio,
egocentric camera views from the head-mounted device, depth maps, head, hand
and gaze tracking information, as well as additional annotations performed
post-hoc. While the dataset is relatively small in size (~ 14 hours), its
application-driven and interactive nature brings to the fore novel research
challenges for human-AI collaboration, and provides more realistic testing
grounds for various AI models operating in this space. In future work, we plan
to use the dataset to construct a set of benchmarks for physically situated
collaboration in mixed-reality task assistive scenarios. SigmaCollab is
available at https://github.com/microsoft/SigmaCollab.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We present DropleX, the first system that enables liquid sensing using the
capacitive touchscreen of commodity tablets. DropleX detects microliter-scale
liquid samples, and performs non-invasive, through-container measurements to
detect whether a drink has been spiked or if a sealed liquid has been
contaminated. These capabilities are made possible by a physics-informed
mechanism that disables the touchscreen's built-in adaptive filters, originally
designed to reject the effects of liquid drops such as rain, without any
hardware modifications. We model the touchscreen's sensing capabilities,
limits, and non-idealities to inform the design of a signal processing and
learning-based pipeline for liquid sensing. Our system achieves 96-99% accuracy
in detecting microliter-scale adulteration in soda, wine, and milk, 93-96%
accuracy in threshold detection of trace chemical concentrations, and 86-96%
accuracy in through-container adulterant detection. Given the predominance of
touchscreens, these exploratory results can open new opportunities for liquid
sensing on everyday devices.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Audience reactions can considerably enhance live experiences; conversely, in
anytime-anywhere augmented reality (AR) experiences, large crowds of people
might not always be available to congregate. To get closer to simulating live
events with large audiences, we created a mobile AR experience where users can
wander around naturally and engage in AR theater with virtual audiences trained
from real audiences using imitation learning. This allows us to carefully
capture the essence of human imperfections and behavior in artificial
intelligence (AI) audiences. The result is a novel mobile AR experience in
which solitary AR users experience an augmented performance in a physical space
with a virtual audience. Virtual dancers emerge from the surroundings,
accompanied by a digitally simulated audience, to provide a community
experience akin to immersive theater. In a pilot study, simulated human avatars
were vastly preferred over just audience audio commentary. We subsequently
engaged 20 participants as attendees of an AR dance performance, comparing a
no-audience condition with a simulated audience of six onlookers. Through
questionnaires and experience reports, we investigated user reactions and
behavior. Our results demonstrate that the presence of virtual audience members
caused attendees to perceive the performance as a social experience with
increased interest and involvement in the event. On the other hand, for some
attendees, the dance performances without the virtual audience evoked a
stronger positive sentiment.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Standard training for Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) involves
concatenating non-textual information, like vision or audio, with a text
prompt. This approach may not encourage deep integration of modalities,
limiting the model's ability to leverage the core language model's reasoning
capabilities. This work examined the impact of interleaved instruction tuning
in an audio MLLM, where audio tokens are interleaved within the prompt. Using
the Listen, Think, and Understand (LTU) model as a testbed, we conduct an
experiment using the Synonym and Hypernym Audio Reasoning Dataset (SHARD), our
newly created reasoning benchmark for audio-based semantic reasoning focusing
on synonym and hypernym recognition. Our findings show that while even
zero-shot interleaved prompting improves performance on our reasoning tasks, a
small amount of fine-tuning using interleaved training prompts improves the
results further, however, at the expense of the MLLM's audio labeling ability.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Existing wireless video transmission schemes directly conduct video coding in
pixel level, while neglecting the inner semantics contained in videos. In this
paper, we propose a wireless video semantic communication framework with
decoupled diffusion multi-frame compensation (DDMFC), abbreviated as WVSC-D,
which integrates the idea of semantic communication into wireless video
transmission scenarios. WVSC-D first encodes original video frames as semantic
frames and then conducts video coding based on such compact representations,
enabling the video coding in semantic level rather than pixel level. Moreover,
to further reduce the communication overhead, a reference semantic frame is
introduced to substitute motion vectors of each frame in common video coding
methods. At the receiver, DDMFC is proposed to generate compensated current
semantic frame by a two-stage conditional diffusion process. With both the
reference frame transmission and DDMFC frame compensation, the bandwidth
efficiency improves with satisfying video transmission performance.
Experimental results verify the performance gain of WVSC-D over other DL-based
methods e.g. DVSC about 1.8 dB in terms of PSNR.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Recent advancements have demonstrated the great potential of flow
matching-based Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in image editing.
However, state-of-the-art works like BAGEL face limitations, including detail
degradation, content inconsistency, and inefficiency due to their reliance on
random noise initialization. To address these issues, we propose LGCC, a novel
framework with two key components: Local Gaussian Noise Coupling (LGNC) and
Content Consistency Loss (CCL). LGNC preserves spatial details by modeling
target image embeddings and their locally perturbed counterparts as coupled
pairs, while CCL ensures semantic alignment between edit instructions and image
modifications, preventing unintended content removal. By integrating LGCC with
the BAGEL pre-trained model via curriculum learning, we significantly reduce
inference steps, improving local detail scores on I2EBench by 1.60% and overall
scores by 0.53%. LGCC achieves 3x -- 5x speedup for lightweight editing and 2x
for universal editing, requiring only 40% -- 50% of the inference time of BAGEL
or Flux. These results demonstrate LGCC's ability to preserve detail, maintain
contextual integrity, and enhance inference speed, offering a cost-efficient
solution without compromising editing quality.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Planning has been a cornerstone of artificial intelligence for solving
complex problems, and recent progress in LLM-based multi-agent frameworks have
begun to extend this capability. However, the role of human-like memory within
these frameworks remains largely unexplored. Understanding how agents
coordinate through memory is critical for natural language planning, where
iterative reasoning, constraint tracking, and error correction drive the
success. Inspired by working memory model in cognitive psychology, we present
EvoMem, a multi-agent framework built on a dual-evolving memory mechanism. The
framework consists of three agents (Constraint Extractor, Verifier, and Actor)
and two memory modules: Constraint Memory (CMem), which evolves across queries
by storing task-specific rules and constraints while remains fixed within a
query, and Query-feedback Memory (QMem), which evolves within a query by
accumulating feedback across iterations for solution refinement. Both memory
modules are reset at the end of each query session. Evaluations on trip
planning, meeting planning, and calendar scheduling show consistent performance
improvements, highlighting the effectiveness of EvoMem. This success
underscores the importance of memory in enhancing multi-agent planning.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: One of the main challenges in managing traffic at multilane intersections is
ensuring smooth coordination between human-driven vehicles (HDVs) and connected
autonomous vehicles (CAVs). This paper presents a novel traffic signal control
framework that combines Graph Attention Networks (GAT) with Soft Actor-Critic
(SAC) reinforcement learning to address this challenge. GATs are used to model
the dynamic graph- structured nature of traffic flow to capture spatial and
temporal dependencies between lanes and signal phases. The proposed SAC is a
robust off-policy reinforcement learning algorithm that enables adaptive signal
control through entropy-optimized decision making. This design allows the
system to coordinate the signal timing and vehicle movement simultaneously with
objectives focused on minimizing travel time, enhancing performance, ensuring
safety, and improving fairness between HDVs and CAVs. The model is evaluated
using a SUMO-based simulation of a four-way intersection and incorporating
different traffic densities and CAV penetration rates. The experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness of the GAT-SAC approach by achieving a 24.1%
reduction in average delay and up to 29.2% fewer traffic violations compared to
traditional methods. Additionally, the fairness ratio between HDVs and CAVs
improved to 1.59, indicating more equitable treatment across vehicle types.
These findings suggest that the GAT-SAC framework holds significant promise for
real-world deployment in mixed-autonomy traffic systems.

Abstract: We study the problem of learning multi-task, multi-agent policies for
cooperative, temporal objectives, under centralized training, decentralized
execution. In this setting, using automata to represent tasks enables the
decomposition of complex tasks into simpler sub-tasks that can be assigned to
agents. However, existing approaches remain sample-inefficient and are limited
to the single-task case. In this work, we present Automata-Conditioned
Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (ACC-MARL), a framework for
learning task-conditioned, decentralized team policies. We identify the main
challenges to ACC-MARL's feasibility in practice, propose solutions, and prove
the correctness of our approach. We further show that the value functions of
learned policies can be used to assign tasks optimally at test time.
Experiments show emergent task-aware, multi-step coordination among agents,
e.g., pressing a button to unlock a door, holding the door, and
short-circuiting tasks.
