In this paper, we propose PartMotionEdit, a novel fine-grained motion editing framework that operates via part-level semantic modulation. The core of PartMotionEdit is a Part-aware Motion Modulation (PMM) module, which builds upon a predefined five-part body decomposition. PMM dynamically predicts time-varying modulation weights for each body part, enabling precise and interpretable editing of local motions. To guide the training of PMM, we also introduce a part-level similarity curve supervision mechanism enhanced with dual-layer normalization. This mechanism assists PMM in learning semantically consistent and editable distributions across all body parts. Furthermore, we design a Bidirectional Motion Interaction (BMI) module. It leverages bidirectional cross-modal attention to achieve more accurate semantic alignment between textual instructions and motion semantics. Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations on a well-known benchmark demonstrate that PartMotionEdit outperforms the state-of-the-art methods."}

Existing methods mostly employ semantic segmentation, focusing on the semantic feature between different types of teeth. However, due to the tightly packed structure of teeth, unclear boundaries, and the diversity of complex cases such as missing teeth, malposed teeth, semantic segmentation often struggles to achieve satisfactory results when dealing with complex dental cases. To address these issues, this paper propose BATISNet, a boundary-aware instance network for tooth point cloud segmentation. This network model consists of a feature extraction backbone and an instance segmentation module. It not only focuses on extracting the semantic features of different types of teeth but also learns the instance features of individual teeth. It helps achieve more robust and accurate tooth instance segmentation in complex clinical scenarios such as missing teeth and malposed teeth. Additionally, to further enhance the completeness and accuracy of tooth boundary segmentation, a boundary-aware loss function is designed to specifically supervise the boundary segmentation between instances. It mitigates effectively tooth adhesion and boundary ambiguity issues. Extensive experimental results show that BATISNet outperforms existing methods in tooth integrity segmentation, providing more reliable and detailed data support for practical clinical applications."}

These anecdotes suggest that AI agents have great potential to offer accessible mental health support. However, it's unclear how to meet this potential in extreme mental health crisis use cases. In this work, we explore the first-person experience of turning to a conversational AI agent in a mental health crisis. From a testimonial survey (n = 53) of lived experiences, we find that people use AI agents to fill the in-between spaces of human support; they turn to AI due to lack of access to mental health professionals or fears of burdening others. At the same time, our interviews with mental health experts (n = 16) suggest that human-human connection is an essential positive action when managing a mental health crisis. Using the stages of change model, our results suggest that a responsible AI crisis intervention is one that increases the user's preparedness to take a positive action while de-escalating any intended negative action. We discuss the implications of designing conversational AI agents as bridges towards human-human connection rather than ends in themselves."}

Open-vocabulary visual effects generation from text inputs emerges as a promising solution that can unlock immense creative potential. However, current pipelines lack both physical realism and effective language interfaces, requiring slow offline optimization. In contrast, PhysTalk takes a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) scene as input and translates arbitrary user prompts into real time, physics based, interactive 4D animations. A large language model (LLM) generates executable code that directly modifies 3DGS parameters through lightweight proxies and particle dynamics. Notably, PhysTalk is the first framework to couple 3DGS directly with a physics simulator without relying on time consuming mesh extraction. While remaining open vocabulary, this design enables interactive 3D Gaussian animation via collision aware, physics based manipulation of arbitrary, multi material objects. Finally, PhysTalk is train-free and computationally lightweight: this makes 4D animation broadly accessible and shifts these workflows from a \"render and wait\" paradigm toward an interactive dialogue with a modern, physics-informed pipeline."}

We set out to understand how people view deletion, the removal of material no longer needed: does it help by reducing clutter and improving the signal to noise ratio, or does the effort required to decide to delete something make it not worthwhile? How does deletion relate to other strategies like filing; do people who spend extensive time in filing also prune their materials too? We studied the behaviour of 51 knowledge workers though a series of questionnaires and interviews to evaluate a range of tactics they used aimed at organizing, filing, and retrieving digital resources. Our study reveals that deletion is consistently under-adopted compared to other tactics such as Filing, Coverage, Ontology, and Timeliness. Moreover, the empirical data indicate that deletion is actually detrimental to retrieval success and satisfaction. In this paper, we examine the practice of deletion, review the related literature, and present detailed statistical results and clustering outcomes that underscore its adverse effects."}

External human--machine interface (eHMI), which employs visual or auditory cues to explicitly convey vehicle behaviors can compensate for the loss of human-like interactions and enhance AV--pedestrian cooperation. To facilitate faster intent convergence between pedestrian and AVs, this study incorporates an adaptive interaction mechanism into eHMI based on pedestrian intent recognition, namely IR-eHMI. IR-eHMI dynamically detects and infers the behavioral intentions of both pedestrians and AVs through identifying their cooperation states. The proposed interaction framework is implemented and evaluated on a virtual reality (VR) experimental platform to demonstrate its effectiveness through statistical analysis. Experimental results show that IR-eHMI significantly improves crossing efficiency, reduces gaze distraction while maintaining interaction safety compared to traditional fixed-distance eHMI. This adaptive and explicit interaction mode introduces an innovative procedural paradigm for AV--pedestrian cooperation."}

Questions on its commercial potential become more pressing as the field becomes mature. To take the field one step further -- as the emergence of components contributed to the commercial development of graphical user interfaces -- this article suggests that applicative tangible user interfaces could also be split into components. These components are composed of the aggregation, combination, or coupling of physical items and fulfil four roles that are described through a new interaction model. This article successfully distributed among these four components' roles all of the 159 physical items from a representative collection of 35 applications. Further examination of these applicative tangible interfaces coincides with four research phases in the field and identifies three main paths for future research to fully realize the potential of tangible user interfaces."}

Various innovative computing modes have been proposed, such as optical, quantum phenomena, and DNA-based modes. Sequential logic circuits are a critical factor that enables these modes to function as general-purpose computers, given their essential role in facilitating continuous computation and memory storage through their ability to store states. However, compared to computability, it is often overlooked due to the difficulty of its implementation. In this paper, we first demonstrate sequential mapping, a crucial necessary condition for electronic computers to realize sequential logic circuits, and highlight this distinctive property of general-purpose computers in the context of logic gate circuits. To achieve computational functionalities comparable to those of electronic computers, we utilize the control effect of enzymes on enzymatic reactions to design a logic gate model that is composed of small molecules and driven by enzymes, subsequently propose a biochemical computing mode. Furthermore, we mathematically analyze the static and dynamic input-output properties of biochemical logic gate components and prove that the biochemical computing mode satisfies sequential mapping similar to electronic computers. When combined with the storage characteristics of NOT-AND gates, it can realize sequential logic circuits. The findings can serve as a theoretical foundation for developing general-purpose biochemical computers."}

To address this challenge, we conducted a formative study and developed ReflecToMeet, an AI assisted system that integrates theory driven reflective prompts with mechanisms for sharing teammates reflections. Informed by ten formative interviews, the system was evaluated in a mixed method study across three conditions: deeper reflection, regular reflection, and a control condition with unstructured reflection. Participants in the control condition demonstrated less deliberate thought and weaker collaboration, which led to stress and misalignment during team meetings. In contrast, structured reflection supported greater organization and steadier progress. The deeper reflection condition further facilitated confidence, teamwork, and idea generation, although it imposed a higher cognitive load. We conclude by discussing design implications for AI agents that facilitate reflection to enhance collaboration and broader considerations for AI assisted systems aimed at sustaining collaborative goals."}

Mimicking this rich functional density could offer a powerful primitive for neuromorphic computing, which has sought to replace the aging digital computing paradigms using biological inspirations. Here, using electrically driven Ovonic threshold switching in Sb-Te-doped GeSe, we demonstrate a single two-terminal component capable of self-sustained dynamics and universal Boolean logic, in addition to XOR operations (which is traditionally thought to require a network of active components). We then employ logic-driven dynamics in a single component to detect and estimate the gradients of edges in images, a task that otherwise requires elaborate circuits. A network of Ovonic switches exhibits properties of a half adder and a full adder, in addition to discriminative logic accommodating inhibitory and excitatory signals. We show that this computational primitive is not only seemingly simpler, but also offers many orders of magnitude improved energy efficiency compared to prevailing digital solutions. As such, this work paves the path for potentially emulating dendrites for efficient post-digital neuromorphic computing."}

This article argues that vibe coding is best understood as interface flattening, a reconfiguration in which previously distinct modalities (GUI, CLI, and API) appear to converge into a single conversational surface, even as the underlying chain of translation from intention to machinic effect lengthens and thickens. Drawing on Friedrich Kittler's materialist media theory and Alexander Galloway's account of interfaces as sites of protocol control, the paper situates programming as a historically localised interface arrangement rather than an essential relation to computation. Through a materialist reconstruction of the contemporary vibe-coding stack, it shows how remote compute infrastructures, latency and connectivity, structured outputs, function/tool calling, and interoperability standards such as the Model Context Protocol relocate control and meaning-making power to model and protocol providers. The apparent democratisation of technical capability therefore depends on new dependencies and new literacies. By foregrounding the tension between experiential flattening and infrastructural thickening, I demonstrate how LLM-mediated development redistributes symbolic labour/power, obscures responsibility, and privatises competencies previously dispersed across programming communities, contributing a critical lens on the political economy of AI-mediated human-computer interaction."}

To enable a comprehensive performance analysis, we devise an extensive set of comparative strategies and evaluate them on a compelling public benchmark. Experimental results show that our unsupervised approach still attains 80% test accuracy, on par with several supervised deep learning-based strategies. Moreover, compared with complex deep learning methods, our SNN implementation is inherently suited to neuromorphic deployment and offers a drastic reduction in model complexity, bringing significant advantages for future neuromorphic practice."}
