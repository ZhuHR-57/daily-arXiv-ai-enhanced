This paper introduces a Self-Evolving Concierge System, a novel architecture utilizing a Dynamic Mixture of Experts (DMoE) approach. Unlike recent self-improving agents that rewrite their own codebase, our system preserves stability by dynamically restructuring its runtime environment: \"hiring\" specialized sub-agents based on real-time conversation analysis. We introduce an asynchronous \"Meta-Cognition Engine\" that detects capability gaps, a Least Recently Used (LRU) eviction policy for resource constraints, and a novel \"Surgical History Pruning\" mechanism to mitigate refusal bias. Experimental results demonstrate that this architecture maintains high task success rates while minimizing token consumption compared to static agent swarms."}

We investigate whether multi-agent systems function as strategic reasoners capable of payoff optimization or as identity-driven actors that prioritize role alignment over explicit incentives. Using Nash equilibrium achievement as a diagnostic for strategic reasoning, we conduct systematic experiments across four LLM architectures (Qwen-7B, Qwen-32B, Llama-8B, Mistral-7B) in complex environmental decision-making games involving four agents. We show that role identity bias fundamentally alters strategic reasoning even when payoff-optimal equilibria exist and complete payoff information is available. Removing personas and providing explicit payoffs enables Qwen models to achieve high Nash equilibrium rates, indicating that both conditions are necessary for strategic reasoning. In contrast, personas systematically bias equilibrium selection toward socially preferred outcomes: with personas present, all of the achieved equilibria correspond to Green Transition, while models entirely fail to reach equilibrium when Tragedy of the Commons is payoff-optimal. The effect of explicit payoffs depends entirely on persona presence, revealing strong interactions between representational design choices. We also observe clear model-dependent patterns. Qwen architectures are highly sensitive to both personas and payoff visibility, whereas Llama and Mistral exhibit rigid reasoning behavior across conditions. These findings demonstrate that representational choices are substantive governance decisions that determine whether multi-agent systems act as strategic reasoners or identity-driven actors, with important implications for real-world deployment."}

Weight updates have a high energy cost and cause device wear, analog states drift, and backpropagation requires a backward pass with reversed signal flow. Here we experimentally demonstrate learning on standard filamentary HfOx/Ti arrays that addresses these challenges with two design choices. First, we realize that standard filamentary HfOx/Ti memristors support sub-1 V reset-only pulses that cut energy, improve endurance, and yield stable analog states. Second, we rely on forward-only training algorithms derived from Hinton's Forward-Forward that use only inference-style operations. We train two-layer classifiers on an ImageNet-resolution four-class task using arrays up to 8,064 devices. Two forward-only variants, the double-pass supervised Forward-Forward and a single-pass competitive rule, achieve test accuracies of 89.5% and 89.6%, respectively; a reference experiment using backpropagation reaches 90.0%. Across five independent runs per method, these accuracies match within statistical uncertainty. Trained models retain accuracy for at least one month under ambient conditions, consistent with the stability of reset-only states. Sub-1 V reset updates use 460 times less energy than conventional program-and-verify programming and require just 46% more energy than inference-only operation. Together, these results establish forward-only, sub-1 V learning on standard filamentary stacks at array scale, outlining a practical, pulse-aware route to adaptive edge intelligence."}

Algorithmic forgetting, or machine unlearning, seeks to remove the influence of specific data from trained models to prevent memorization of sensitive information and the generation of harmful content, yet existing exact and approximate unlearning schemes incur prohibitive programming overheads on RM hardware owing to device variability and iterative write-verify cycles. Analogue implementations of continual learning face similar barriers. Here we present a hardware-software co-design that enables an efficient training, deployment and inference pipeline for machine unlearning and continual learning on RM accelerators. At the software level, we introduce a low-rank adaptation (LoRA) framework that confines updates to compact parameter branches, substantially reducing the number of trainable parameters and therefore the training cost. At the hardware level, we develop a hybrid analogue-digital compute-in-memory system in which well-trained weights are stored in analogue RM arrays, whereas dynamic LoRA updates are implemented in a digital computing unit with SRAM buffer. This hybrid architecture avoids costly reprogramming of analogue weights and maintains high energy efficiency during inference. Fabricated in a 180 nm CMOS process, the prototype achieves up to a 147.76-fold reduction in training cost, a 387.95-fold reduction in deployment overhead and a 48.44-fold reduction in inference energy across privacy-sensitive tasks including face recognition, speaker authentication and stylized image generation, paving the way for secure and efficient neuromorphic intelligence at the edge."}

As our vector fields are continuous and weakly differentiable, we can use them to define a covariant derivative field that is evaluatable almost-everywhere on the mesh. Decomposing the covariant derivative in terms of diagonal multiple of the identity, anti-symmetric, and trace-less symmetric components, we can define the standard operators used for vector field processing including the Hodge Laplacian energy, Connection Laplacian energy, and Killing energy. Additionally, the ability to perform point-wise evaluation of the covariant derivative also makes it possible for us to define the Lie bracket."}

It critiques prevailing legal frameworks that prioritize technological infrastructure and platform control over data and individual autonomy, exposing their structural limitations. In response, the article advances a human-centric model of data governance grounded in individual dominion and a private-by-default principle.

Cataloging basic patterns in the atomic displacements is key to understanding and predicting the evolution of physical properties. However, the combinatorial complexity of the space of possible transitions coupled with the overwhelming amount of data being produced by high-throughput simulations make such an analysis extremely challenging and time-consuming for domain experts. The development of visual analytics systems that facilitate the exploration of simulation data is an active field of research. While these systems excel in identifying temporal regions of interest, they treat each timestep of a simulation as an independent event without considering the behavior of the atomic displacements between timesteps. We address this gap by introducing LAMDA, a visual analytics system that allows domain experts to quickly and systematically explore state-to-state transitions. In LAMDA, transitions are hierarchically categorized, providing a basis for cataloging displacement behavior, as well as enabling the analysis of simulations at different resolutions, ranging from very broad qualitative classes of transitions to very narrow definitions of unit processes. LAMDA supports navigating the hierarchy of transitions, enabling scientists to visualize the commonalities between different transitions in each class in terms of invariant features characterizing local atomic environments, and LAMDA simplifies the analysis by capturing user inputs through annotations. We evaluate our system through a case study and report on findings from our domain experts."}

Existing multi-hop UAV networks employ a single routing path by selecting the next-hop forwarding node in a hop-by-hop manner, which leads to local congestion and increases traffic delays. In this paper, a novel traffic-adaptive multipath routing method is proposed for multi-hop UAV networks, which enables each UAV to dynamically split and forward traffic flows across multiple next-hop neighbors, thus meeting latency requirements of diverse traffic flows in dynamic mobile environments. An on-time packet delivery ratio maximization problem is formulated to determine the traffic splitting ratios at each hop. This sequential decision-making problem is modeled as a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process (Dec-POMDP). To solve this Dec-POMDP, a novel multi-agent deep reinforcement leaning (MADRL) algorithm, termed Independent Proximal Policy Optimization with Dirichlet Modeling (IPPO-DM), is developed. Specifically, the IPPO serves as the core optimization framework, where the Dirichlet distribution is leveraged to parameterize a continuous stochastic policy network on the probability simplex, inherently ensuring feasible traffic splitting ratios. Simulation results demonstrate that IPPO-DM outperforms benchmark schemes in terms of both delivery latency guarantee and packet loss performance."}

However, what is deemed \"aesthetic\" is inextricably linked to personal taste and cultural values, raising the question of whose taste is represented in visual generative AI models. In this work, we study an aesthetic evaluation model--LAION Aesthetic Predictor (LAP)--that is widely used to curate datasets to train visual generative image models, like Stable Diffusion, and evaluate the quality of AI-generated images. To understand what LAP measures, we audited the model across three datasets. First, we examined the impact of aesthetic filtering on the LAION-Aesthetics Dataset (approximately 1.2B images), which was curated from LAION-5B using LAP. We find that the LAP disproportionally filters in images with captions mentioning women, while filtering out images with captions mentioning men or LGBTQ+ people. Then, we used LAP to score approximately 330k images across two art datasets, finding the model rates realistic images of landscapes, cityscapes, and portraits from western and Japanese artists most highly. In doing so, the algorithmic gaze of this aesthetic evaluation model reinforces the imperial and male gazes found within western art history. In order to understand where these biases may have originated, we performed a digital ethnography of public materials related to the creation of LAP. We find that the development of LAP reflects the biases we found in our audits, such as the aesthetic scores used to train LAP primarily coming from English-speaking photographers and western AI-enthusiasts. In response, we discuss how aesthetic evaluation can perpetuate representational harms and call on AI developers to shift away from prescriptive measures of \"aesthetics\" toward more pluralistic evaluation."}

In this work, we investigate learning-based orchestration of multi-agent systems with explicit latency supervision under parallel execution. We propose Latency-Aware Multi-agent System (LAMaS), a latency-aware multi-agent orchestration framework that enables parallel execution and explicitly optimizes the critical execution path, allowing the controller to construct execution topology graphs with lower latency under parallel execution. Our experiments show that our approach reduces critical path length by 38-46% compared to the state-of-the-art baseline for multi-agent architecture search across multiple benchmarks, while maintaining or even improving task performance.

We then scaled up to 18,000 simulated conversations across five politeness profiles (including impolite) and three open-weight models. Results show that politeness is not only cosmetic: it systematically affects response length, informational gain, and efficiency. Engagement-seeking prompts produced up to 90% longer replies and 38% more information nuggets than hyper-efficient prompts, but at markedly lower density. Impolite inputs yielded verbose but less efficient answers, with up to 48% fewer nuggets per watt-hour compared to polite input. These findings highlight politeness as both a fairness and sustainability issue: conversational styles can advantage or disadvantage users, and \"polite\" requests may carry hidden energy costs.

We introduce a new fairness objective, procedural fairness, which provides equal decision-making power for all agents, lies in the core, and provides for proportionality in outcomes. Empirical results confirm that fairness notions based on optimizing for outcomes sacrifice equal voice and representation, while the sacrifice in outcome-based fairness objectives (like equality and utilitarianism) is minimal under procedurally fair policies. We further prove that different fairness notions prioritize fundamentally different and incompatible values, highlighting that fairness requires explicit normative choices. This paper argues that procedural legitimacy deserves greater focus as a fairness objective, and provides a framework for putting procedural fairness into practice."}

To address these barriers, we evaluated how foundation models can paraphrase older adults' queries to improve solution accuracy. Two controlled experiments followed: one with younger adults evaluating AI-rephrased queries and another with older adults evaluating AI-generated solutions. We also developed a pipeline using large language models to generate the first synthetic dataset of how older adults request tech support (OATS). We identified four key communication challenges: verbosity, incompleteness, over-specification, and under-specification. Our prompt-chaining approach using the large language model, GPT-4o, elicited contextual details, paraphrased the original query, and generated a solution. AI-rephrased queries significantly improved solution accuracy (69% vs. 46%) and Google search results (69% vs. 35%). Younger adults better understood AI-rephrased queries (93.7% vs. 65.8%) and reported greater confidence and ease.

However, legacy tabular interfaces create a major bottleneck: engineers cannot easily comprehend how parameters relate across the system, leading to inefficient workflows, costly configuration errors, and reduced system trust - a fundamental program comprehension challenge in configuration-intensive software. This research evaluates whether interactive Sankey diagrams can improve comprehension of parameter dependencies compared to traditional spreadsheet interfaces. We employed a heuristic evaluation using the PURE method with three expert evaluators (UX design, simulation, and software development specialists) to compare a Sankey-based prototype to traditional tabular representations for core engineering tasks. Our key contribution demonstrates that flow-based parameter visualizations significantly reduce cognitive load (51% lower PURE scores) and interaction complexity (56% fewer steps) compared to traditional tables, while making parameter dependencies immediately visible rather than requiring mental reconstruction. By explicitly visualizing parameter relationships, Sankey diagrams address a core software visualization challenge: helping users comprehend complex system configurations without requiring deep tool-specific knowledge. While demonstrated through CAE software, this research contributes to program comprehension and software visualization by showing that dependency-aware visualizations can significantly improve understanding of configuration-intensive systems. The findings have implications for any software domain where comprehending complex parameter relationships is essential for effective system use and maintenance."}

Design Patterns for Preserving Authorship in AI-Assisted Writing", "comment": "Preprint; 42 pages", "summary": "AI writing assistants can reduce effort and improve fluency, but they may also weaken writers' sense of authorship. We study this tension with an ownership-aware co-writing editor that offers on-demand, sentence-level suggestions and tests two common design choices: persona-based coaching and style personalization. In an online study (N=176), participants completed three professional writing tasks: an email without AI help, a proposal with generic AI suggestions, and a cover letter with persona-based coaching, while half received suggestions tailored to a brief sample of their prior writing. Across the two AI-assisted tasks, psychological ownership dropped relative to unassisted writing (about 0.85-1.0 points on a 7-point scale), even as cognitive load decreased (about 0.9 points) and quality ratings stayed broadly similar overall. Persona coaching did not prevent the ownership decline. Style personalization partially restored ownership (about +0.43) and increased AI incorporation in text (+5 percentage points). We distill five design patterns: on-demand initiation, micro-suggestions, voice anchoring, audience scaffolds, and point-of-decision provenance, to guide authorship-preserving writing tools."}

Understanding when humans are receptive to such proactive AI assistance during their daily work remains an open question in human-AI interaction research. We address this gap through a field study of proactive AI assistance in professional developer workflows. We present a five-day in-the-wild study with 15 developers who interacted with a proactive feature of an AI assistant integrated into a production-grade IDE that offers code quality suggestions based on in-IDE developer activity. We examined 229 AI interventions across 5,732 interaction points to understand how proactive suggestions are received across workflow stages, how developers experience them, and their perceived impact. Our findings reveal systematic patterns in human receptivity to proactive suggestions: interventions at workflow boundaries (e.g., post-commit) achieved 52% engagement rates, while mid-task interventions (e.g., on declined edit) were dismissed 62% of the time. Notably, well-timed proactive suggestions required significantly less interpretation time than reactive suggestions (45.4s versus 101.4s, W = 109.00, r = 0.533, p = 0.0016), indicating enhanced cognitive alignment. This study provides actionable implications for designing proactive coding assistants, including how to time interventions, align them with developer context, and strike a balance between AI agency and user control in production IDEs."}

The effectiveness of such malicious applications depends on the ability of deepfakes to deceive their audience. Therefore, researchers have investigated human abilities to detect deepfakes in various studies. However, most of these studies were conducted with participants who focused exclusively on the detection task; hence the studies may not provide a complete picture of human abilities to detect deepfakes under realistic conditions: Social media users are exposed to cognitive load on the platform, which can impair their detection abilities. In this paper, we investigate the influence of cognitive load on human detection abilities of voice-based deepfakes in an empirical study with 30 participants. Our results suggest that low cognitive load does not generally impair detection abilities, and that the simultaneous exposure to a secondary stimulus can actually benefit people in the detection task."}

However, as the axes are complex, non-linear combinations of features, they often lack semantic interpretability. Existing visual analytics (VA) methods support cluster interpretation through feature comparison and interactive exploration, but they require technical expertise and intense human effort. We present \\textit{LangLasso}, a novel method that complements VA approaches through interactive, natural language descriptions of clusters using large language models (LLMs). It produces human-readable descriptions that make cluster interpretation accessible to non-experts and allow integration of external contextual knowledge beyond the dataset. We systematically evaluate the reliability of these explanations and demonstrate that \\langlasso provides an effective first step for engaging broader audiences in cluster interpretation.

We analyze Reddit discussions to investigate how users detect, mitigate, and perceive sycophantic AI. We develop the ODR Framework that maps user experiences across three stages: observing sycophantic behaviors, detecting sycophancy, and responding to these behaviors. Our findings reveal that users employ various detection techniques, including cross-platform comparison and inconsistency testing. We document diverse mitigation approaches, such as persona-based prompts to specific language patterns in prompt engineering. We find sycophancy's effects are context-dependent rather than universally harmful. Specifically, vulnerable populations experiencing trauma, mental health challenges, or isolation actively seek and value sycophantic behaviors as emotional support. Users develop both technical and folk explanations for why sycophancy occurs. These findings challenge the assumption that sycophancy should be eliminated universally. We conclude by proposing context-aware AI design that balances the risks with the benefits of affirmative interaction, while discussing implications for user education and transparency."}

However, existing deep learning approaches often overlook the brain's intrinsic spatial organization, failing to simultaneously capture local topological relations and global dependencies. To address these challenges, we propose Neuro-HGLN, a Neurologically-informed Hierarchical Graph-Transformer Learning Network that integrates biologically grounded priors with hierarchical representation learning. Neuro-HGLN first constructs a spatial Euclidean prior graph based on physical electrode distances to serve as an anatomically grounded inductive bias. A learnable global dynamic graph is then introduced to model functional connectivity across the entire brain. In parallel, to capture fine-grained regional dependencies, Neuro-HGLN builds region-level local graphs using a multi-head self-attention mechanism. These graphs are processed synchronously through local-constrained parallel GCN layers to produce region-specific representations. Subsequently, an iTransformer encoder aggregates these features to capture cross-region dependencies under a dimension-as-token formulation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Neuro-HGLN achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks, providing enhanced interpretability grounded in neurophysiological structure. These results highlight the efficacy of unifying local topological learning with cross-region dependency modeling for robust EEG emotion recognition."}

The key results demonstrate the efficiency of the T5 model in prompt generation, with an accuracy of 98% and a BLEU score of 0.2668, which ensures the mapping of JSON to descriptive prompts.

Final published version available at DOI: 10.1145/3786169.3788398", "summary": "Block-based programming environments (BBPEs) such as Scratch and Code.org are now widely used in K-12 computer science classes, but they remain mostly inaccessible to blind or visually impaired (BVI) learners. A major problem is that prior accessibility solutions have relied on modifications to the Blockly library, making them difficult to apply in existing BBPEs and thereby limiting adoption. We present an Extension-based Accessibility Framework (EAF) to make BBPEs accessible for BVI students. The framework uses a modular architecture that enables seamless integration with existing Blockly-based BBPEs. We present an innovative three-dimensional (3D) hierarchical navigation model featuring stack labeling and block numbering, mode-based editing to prevent accidental modifications, and WAI-ARIA implementation to ensure compatibility with external screen readers. We evaluated our approach by integrating the EAF framework into two BBPEs (covering 177 test cases) and conducting semi-structured interviews with four participants using VoiceOver, JAWS, and NVDA. Participants reported clearer spatial orientation and easier mental model formation compared to default Blockly keyboard navigation. EAF shows that modular architecture can provide comprehensive accessibility while ensuring compatibility with existing BBPEs."}
