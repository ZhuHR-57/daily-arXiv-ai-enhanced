Abstract: Mental disorders are highly prevalent worldwide, but the shortage of psychiatrists and the inherent subjectivity of interview-based diagnosis create substantial barriers to timely and consistent mental-health assessment. Progress in AI-assisted psychiatric diagnosis is constrained by the absence of benchmarks that simultaneously provide realistic patient simulation, clinician-verified diagnostic labels, and support for dynamic multi-turn consultation. We present LingxiDiagBench, a large-scale multi-agent benchmark that evaluates LLMs on both static diagnostic inference and dynamic multi-turn psychiatric consultation in Chinese. At its core is LingxiDiag-16K, a dataset of 16,000 EMR-aligned synthetic consultation dialogues designed to reproduce real clinical demographic and diagnostic distributions across 12 ICD-10 psychiatric categories. Through extensive experiments across state-of-the-art LLMs, we establish key findings: (1) although LLMs achieve high accuracy on binary depression--anxiety classification (up to 92.3%), performance deteriorates substantially for depression--anxiety comorbidity recognition (43.0%) and 12-way differential diagnosis (28.5%); (2) dynamic consultation often underperforms static evaluation, indicating that ineffective information-gathering strategies significantly impair downstream diagnostic reasoning; (3) consultation quality assessed by LLM-as-a-Judge shows only moderate correlation with diagnostic accuracy, suggesting that well-structured questioning alone does not ensure correct diagnostic decisions. We release LingxiDiag-16K and the full evaluation framework to support reproducible research at https://github.com/Lingxi-mental-health/LingxiDiagBench.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Since the early 2000s, control of multiagent systems has attracted significant research interest, with applications ranging from natural collective behaviors and social dynamics to engineered systems such as autonomous vehicles, sensor networks, and smart grids. Although research on multi-agent systems has diversified into numerous specialized directions, textbooks -- including those in English -- that provide a systematic treatment of the fundamental principles of multi-agent system control remain scarce. The material presented in this book has been developed and used in teaching since 2021, initially as a concise Vietnamese-language reference for the courses Networked Control Systems and Control of Multi-Agent Systems at Hanoi University of Science and Technology. The book focuses on a selection of fundamental topics of broad and continuing interest in the field. The complexity of several topics is asymptotic to that encountered in research-level studies, however, the analysis is presented in a step-by-step manner to facilitate access to commonly used methods and tools.
  The material is divided into three main parts. Part I introduces multiagent systems and basic graph-theoretic concepts. Part II addresses the design and analysis of linear consensus algorithms. Part III covers selected applications and research directions, including formation control, network localization, distributed optimization, opinion dynamics, and matrix-weighted networks. Each chapter concludes with notes on notable researchers in this field, further reading, and exercises.
  This book cannot be completed without the encouragement, support and suggestions from families, colleagues and friends. The authors appreciate feedback from readers to further improve the content of the book.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Most machine learning approaches to scientific discovery frame hypotheses as end-to-end predictions, obscuring the incremental structure of scientific reasoning. We propose The Hypothesis Game, a symbolic formalism for hypothesis refinement in which LLM agents operate on a shared hypothesis state using a fixed grammar of reasoning moves. The framework is motivated by the observation that scientific progress often proceeds through small, localized revisions, grounded in domain context, rather than extensive rewrites. We instantiate a minimal game with LLM agents and evaluate it on pathway-level mechanistic refinement tasks. In the primary setting of corruption recovery, where hypotheses contain controlled errors, the game-based approach consistently removes more errors and achieves higher precision than strong prompting baselines, while preserving valid structure through incremental edits. In a secondary reconstruction setting from partial cues, it performs comparably to the strongest baseline, indicating that explicit move-based refinement remains competitive even when ground-truth recovery is difficult. These findings support game-based reasoning as a principled route to more controllable, interpretable, and transferable hypothesis refinement systems for scientific discovery.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Forward Error Correction (FEC) remains essential for protecting video streaming against packet loss, yet most real deployments still rely on static, coarse-grained configurations that cannot react to rapid shifts in loss rate, goodput, or client buffer levels. These rigid settings often create inefficiencies: unnecessary redundancy that suppresses throughput during stable periods, and insufficient protection during bursty losses, especially when shallow buffers and oversized blocks increase stall risk. To address these challenges, we present TAROT, a cross-layer, optimization-driven FEC controller that selects redundancy, block size, and symbolization on a per-segment basis. TAROT is codec-agnostic--supporting Reed-Solomon, RaptorQ, and XOR-based codes--and evaluates a pre-computed candidate set using a fine-grained scoring model. The scoring function jointly incorporates transport-layer loss and goodput, application layer buffer dynamics, and block-level timing constraints to penalize insufficient coverage, excessive overhead, and slow block completion. To enable realistic testing, we extend the SABRE simulator 1 with two new modules: a high-fidelity packet-loss generator that replays diverse multi-trace loss patterns, and a modular FEC benchmarking layer supporting arbitrary code/parameter combinations. Across Low-Latency Live (LLL) and Video-on-Demand (VoD) streaming modes, diverse network traces, and multiple ABR algorithms, TAROT reduces FEC overhead by up to 43% while improving perceptual quality by 10 VMAF units with minimal rebuffering, achieving a stronger overhead-quality balance than static FECs.

Abstract: Project Sidewalk is a web-based platform that enables crowdsourcing accessibility of sidewalks at city-scale by virtually walking through city streets using Google Street View. The tool has been used in 40 cities across the world, including the US, Mexico, Chile, and Europe. In this paper, we describe adaptation efforts to enable deployment in Chandigarh, India, including modifying annotation types, provided examples, and integrating VLM-based mission guidance, which adapts instructions based on a street scene and metadata analysis. Our evaluation with 3 annotators indicates the utility of AI-mission guidance with an average score of 4.66. Using this adapted Project Sidewalk tool, we conduct a Points of Interest (POI)-centric accessibility analysis for three sectors in Chandigarh with very different land uses, residential, commercial and institutional covering about 40 km of sidewalks. Across 40 km of roads audited in three sectors and around 230 POIs, we identified 1,644 of 2,913 locations where infrastructure improvements could enhance accessibility.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Version control is critical in mechanical computer-aided design (CAD) to enable traceability, manage product variation, and support collaboration. Yet, its implementation in modern CAD software as an essential information infrastructure for product development remains plagued by issues due to the complexity and interdependence of design data. This paper presents a systematic review of user-reported challenges with version control in modern CAD tools. Analyzing 170 online forum threads, we identify recurring socio-technical issues that span the management, continuity, scope, and distribution of versions. Our findings inform a broader reflection on how version control should be designed and improved for CAD and motivate opportunities for tools and mechanisms that better support articulation work, facilitate cross-boundary collaboration, and operate with infrastructural reflexivity. This study offers actionable insights for CAD software providers and highlights opportunities for researchers to rethink version control.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Bystander privacy in smart homes has been widely studied in Western contexts, yet it remains underexplored in non-Western countries such as China. In this study, we analyze 49 Chinese smart home apps using a mixed-methods approach, including privacy policy review, UX/UI evaluation, and assessment of Apple App Store privacy labels. While most apps nominally comply with national regulations, we identify significant gaps between written policies and actual implementation. Our traceability analysis highlights inconsistencies in data controls and a lack of transparency in data-sharing practices. Crucially, bystander privacy -- particularly for visitors and non-user individuals -- is largely absent from both policy documents and interface design. Additionally, discrepancies between privacy labels and actual data practices threaten user trust and undermine informed consent. We provide design recommendations to strengthen bystander protections, improve privacy-oriented UI transparency, and enhance the credibility of privacy labels, supporting the development of inclusive smart home ecosystems in non-Western contexts.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: As more young women in China live alone, they navigate entangled privacy, security, and safety (PSS) risks across smart homes, online platforms, and public infrastructures. Drawing on six participatory threat modeling (PTM) workshops (n = 33), we present a human-centered threat model that illustrates how digitally facilitated physical violence, digital harassment and scams, and pervasive surveillance by individuals, companies, and the state are interconnected and mutually reinforcing. We also document four mitigation strategies employed by participants: smart home device configurations, boundary management, sociocultural practices, and social media tactics--each of which can introduce new vulnerabilities and emotional burdens. Based on these insights, we developed a digital PSS guidebook for young women living alone (YWLA) in China. We further propose actionable design implications for smart home devices and social media platforms, along with policy and legal recommendations and directions for educational interventions.

Abstract: Think-Aloud Computing, a method for capturing users' verbalized thoughts during software tasks, allows eliciting rich contextual insights into evolving intentions, struggles, and decision-making processes of users in real-time. However, existing approaches face practical challenges: users often lack awareness of what is captured by the system, are not effectively encouraged to speak, and miss or are interrupted by system feedback. Additionally, thinking aloud should feel worthwhile for users due to the gained contextual AI assistance. To better support and harness Think-Aloud Computing, we introduce PointAloud, a suite of novel AI-driven pointer-centric interactions for in-the-moment verbalization encouragement, low-distraction system feedback, and contextually rich work process documentation alongside proactive AI assistance. Our user study with 12 participants provides insights into the value of pointer-centric think-aloud computing for work process documentation and human-AI co-creation. We conclude by discussing the broader implications of our findings and design considerations for pointer-centric and AI-supported Think-Aloud Computing workflows.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Computer Use Agents (CUAs) operate interfaces by pointing, clicking, and typing -- mirroring interactions of sighted users (SUs) who can thus monitor CUAs and share control. CUAs do not reflect interactions by blind and low-vision users (BLVUs) who use assistive technology (AT). BLVUs thus cannot easily collaborate with CUAs. To characterize the accessibility gap of CUAs, we present A11y-CUA, a dataset of BLVUs and SUs performing 60 everyday tasks with 40.4 hours and 158,325 events. Our dataset analysis reveals that our collected interaction traces quantitatively confirm distinct interaction styles between SU and BLVU groups (mouse- vs. keyboard-dominant) and demonstrate interaction diversity within each group (sequential vs. shortcut navigation for BLVUs). We then compare collected traces to state-of-the-art CUAs under default and AT conditions (keyboard-only, magnifier). The default CUA executed 78.3% of tasks successfully. But with the AT conditions, CUA's performance dropped to 41.67% and 28.3% with keyboard-only and magnifier conditions respectively, and did not reflect nuances of real AT use. With our open A11y-CUA dataset, we aim to promote collaborative and accessible CUAs for everyone.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Providing mental health support for loved ones across a geographic distance creates unique challenges for the remote caregivers, who sometimes turn to online communities for peer support. We qualitatively analyzed 522 Reddit threads to understand what drives remote caregivers' online help-seeking behaviors and the responses they receive from the community. Their purposes of posting included requesting guidance, expressing emotions, and seeking validation. Community responses included providing emotional support, suggesting informational strategies, and sharing personal experiences. While certain themes in posts (emotional toll, monitoring symptoms, and prioritizing caregiver well-being) are shared across remote and non-remote contexts, remote caregivers' posts surfaced nuanced experiences. For example, they often rely on digital cues, such as voice, to interpret care receivers' well-being while struggling with digital silence during crises. We discuss the need for supporting communication and information sharing between remote caregivers and receivers, care coordination for crisis management, and design recommendations for caregiver communities.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: For university students transitioning to an independent and flexible lifestyle, having ADHD poses multiple challenges to their academic task management, which are closely tied to their metacognitive struggles--difficulties in awareness and regulation of one's own thinking processes. The recently surged Generative AI shows promise to mitigate these gaps with its advanced information understanding and generation capabilities. As an exploratory step, we conducted co-design sessions with 20 university students diagnosed with ADHD, followed by interviews with five experts specialized in ADHD intervention. Adopting a metacognitive lens, we examined participants' ideas on GenAI-based task management support and experts' assessments, which led to three design directions: providing cognitive scaffolding to enhance task and self-awareness, promoting reflective task execution for building metacognitive abilities, and facilitating emotional regulation to sustain task engagement. Drawing on these findings, we discuss opportunities for GenAI to support the metacognitive needs of neurodivergent populations, offering future directions for both research and practice.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: While the proliferation of foundation models has significantly boosted individual productivity, it also introduces a potential challenge: the homogenization of creative content. In response, we revisit Design-by-Analogy (DbA), a cognitively grounded approach that fosters novel solutions by mapping inspiration across domains. However, prevailing perspectives often restrict DbA to early ideation or specific data modalities, while reducing AI-driven design to simplified input-output pipelines. Such conceptual limitations inadvertently foster widespread design fixation. To address this, we expand the understanding of DbA by embedding it into the entire creative process, thereby demonstrating its capacity to mitigate such fixation. Through a systematic review of 85 studies, we identify six forms of representation and classify techniques across seven stages of the creative process. We further discuss three major application domains: creative industries, intelligent manufacturing, and education and services, demonstrating DbA's practical relevance. Building on this synthesis, we frame DbA as a mediating technology for human-AI collaboration and outline the potential opportunities and inherent risks for advancing creativity support in HCI and design research.

Abstract: Thematic jokes are central to stand-up comedy, sitcoms, and public speaking, where contexts and punchlines rely on fresh material - news, anecdotes, and cultural references that resonate with the audience. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled interactive joke generation through conversational interfaces. Although LLMs enable interactive joke generation, ordinary conversational interfaces seldom give creators enough agency, control, or timely access to such source material for constructing context and punchlines. We designed Jokeasy, a search-enabled prototype system that integrates a dual-role LLM agent acting as both a material scout and a prototype writer to support human-AI collaboration in thematic joke writing. Jokeasy provides a visual canvas in which retrieved web content is organized into editable inspiration blocks and developed through a multistage workflow. A qualitative study with 13 hobbyists and 5 expert participants (including professional comedians and HCI/AI specialists) showed that weaving real-time web material into this structured workflow enriches ideation and preserves author agency, while also revealing needs for finer search control, tighter chat-canvas integration, and more flexible visual editing. These insights refine our understanding of AI-assisted humour writing and guide future creative-writing tools.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Rapid eating is common yet difficult to regulate in situ, partly because people seldom notice pace changes and sustained self-monitoring is effortful. We present Earinter, a commodity-earbud-based closed-loop system that integrates in-the-wild sensing, real-time reasoning, and theory-grounded just-in-time (JIT) intervention to regulate eating pace during daily meals. Earinter repurposes the earbud's bone-conduction voice sensor to capture chewing-related vibrations and estimate eating pace as chews per swallow (CPS) for on-device inference. With data collected equally across in-lab and in-the-wild sessions, Earinter achieves reliable chewing detection (F1 = 0.97) and accurate eating pace estimation (MAE: 0.18 $\pm$ 0.13 chews/min, 3.65 $\pm$ 3.86 chews/swallow), enabling robust tracking for closed-loop use. Guided by Dual Systems Theory and refined through two Wizard-of-Oz pilots, Earinter adopts a user-friendly design for JIT intervention content and delivery policy in daily meals. In a 13-day within-subject field study (N=14), the closed-loop system significantly increased CPS and reduced food-consumption speed, with statistical signs of carryover on retention-probe days and acceptable user burden. Our findings highlight how single-modality commodity earables can support practical, theory-driven closed-loop JIT interventions for regulating eating pace in the wild.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: This paper presents a theoretical model for interactive visualization literacy to describe how people use interactive data visualizations and systems. Literacies have become an important concept in describing modern life skills, with visualization literacy generally referring to the use and interpretation of data visualizations. However, prior work on visualization literacy overlooks interaction and its associated challenges, despite it being an intrinsic aspect of using visualizations. Based on existing theoretical frameworks, we derive a two-dimensional model that combines four well-known literacies with five novel ones. We found evidence for our model through analyzing existing visualization systems as well as through observations from an exploratory study involving such systems. We conclude by outlining steps towards measuring, evaluating, designing for, and teaching interactive visualization literacy.

We open-source three custom Python libraries (psychopylib, pymarkerlib, and pyfieldtriplib) each covering different aspects of a closed-loop BCI interface: designing interactive experiments, sending event information, and real-time signal processing. Our modules facilitate the design and operation of a transparent BCI system, promoting customization and flexibility in BCI research, and lowering the barrier for researchers to translate advances in ECoG decoding into BCI applications.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: College students increasingly use AI chatbots to support academic reading, yet we lack granular understanding of how these interactions shape their reading experience and cognitive engagement. We conducted an eight-week longitudinal study with 15 undergraduates who used AI to support assigned readings in a course. We collected 838 prompts across 239 reading sessions and developed a coding schema categorizing prompts into four cognitive themes: Decoding, Comprehension, Reasoning, and Metacognition. Comprehension prompts dominated (59.6%), with Reasoning (29.8%), Metacognition (8.5%), and Decoding (2.1%) less frequent. Most sessions (72%) contained exactly three prompts, the required minimum of the reading assignment. Within sessions, students showed natural cognitive progression from comprehension toward reasoning, but this progression was truncated. Across eight weeks, students' engagement patterns remained stable, with substantial individual differences persisting throughout. Qualitative analysis revealed an intention-behavior gap: students recognized that effective prompting required effort but rarely applied this knowledge, with efficiency emerging as the primary driver. Students also strategically triaged their engagement based on interest and academic pressures, exhibiting a novel pattern of reading through AI rather than with it: using AI-generated summaries as primary material to filter which sections merited deeper attention. We discuss design implications for AI reading systems that scaffold sustained cognitive engagement.

Abstract: Interior design often struggles to capture the subtleties of client experience, leaving gaps between what clients feel and what designers can act upon. We present AIDED, a designer-AI co-design workflow that integrates multimodal client data into generative AI (GAI) design processes. In a within-subjects study with twelve professional designers, we compared four modalities: baseline briefs, gaze heatmaps, questionnaire visualizations, and AI-predicted overlays. Results show that questionnaire data were trusted, creativity-enhancing, and satisfying; gaze heatmaps increased cognitive load; and AI-predicted overlays improved GAI communication but required natural language mediation to establish trust. Interviews confirmed that an authenticity-interpretability trade-off is central to balancing client voices with professional control. Our contributions are: (1) a system that incorporates experiential client signals into GAI design workflows; (2) empirical evidence of how different modalities affect design outcomes; and (3) implications for future AI tools that support human-data interaction in creative practice.
