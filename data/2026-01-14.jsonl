Against this background, blendshapes have become a common industry animation solution because of their relative simplicity and ease of interpretation. Aiming for real-time performance and low computing resource dependence, we independently developed an accurate blendshape prediction system for low-power VR applications using a standard webcam. First, blendshape feature vectors are extracted through affine transformation and segmentation. Through further transformation and regression analysis, we were able to identify models for most blendshapes with significant predictive power. Post-processing was used to further improve response stability, including smoothing filtering and nonlinear transformations to minimize error. Experiments showed the system achieved accuracy similar to ARKit 6. Our model has low sensor/hardware requirements and realtime response with a consistent, accurate and smooth visual experience."}

Yet most systems are designed to optimise retrieval rather than to help users develop better search strategies or critical awareness. This paper introduces a pedagogical perspective on information access, conceptualising search and conversational systems as instructive interfaces that can teach, guide, and scaffold users' learning. We draw on seven didactic frameworks from education and behavioural science to analyse how existing and emerging system features, including query suggestions, source labels, and conversational or agentic AI, support or limit user learning. Using two illustrative search tasks, we demonstrate how different design choices promote skills such as critical evaluation, metacognitive reflection, and strategy transfer. The paper contributes a conceptual lens for evaluating the instructional value of information access systems and outlines design implications for technologies that foster more effective, reflective, and resilient information seekers."}

Furthermore, generative-AIbased products like ChatGPT gradually become an essential element for the retrieval of online information. However, the interaction between domainspecific knowledge and AI-generated content during online decision-making is unclear. We conducted a lab-based explanatory sequential study with university students to overcome this research gap. In the experiment, we surveyed participants about a set of general domain topics that are easy to grasp and another set of domain-specific topics that require adequate levels of chemical science knowledge to fully comprehend. We provided participants with decision-supporting information that was either produced using generative AI or collected from selected expert human-written sources to explore the role of AI-generated content compared to ordinary information during decision-making. Our result revealed that participants are less likely to change opinions on domain-specific topics. Since participants without professional knowledge had difficulty performing in-depth and independent reasoning based on the information, they favoured relying on conclusions presented in the provided materials and tended to stick to their initial opinion. Besides, information that is labelled as AI-generated is equivalently helpful as information labelled as dedicatedly human-written for participants in this experiment, indicating the vast potential as well as concerns for AI replacing human experts to help users tackle professional topics or issues."}

Code available at https://github.com/Govcraft/latin-experiment", "summary": "Current multi-agent LLM frameworks rely on explicit orchestration patterns borrowed from human organizational structures: planners delegate to executors, managers coordinate workers, and hierarchical control flow governs agent interactions. These approaches suffer from coordination overhead that scales poorly with agent count and task complexity. We propose a fundamentally different paradigm inspired by natural coordination mechanisms: agents operate locally on a shared artifact, guided only by pressure gradients derived from measurable quality signals, with temporal decay preventing premature convergence. We formalize this as optimization over a pressure landscape and prove convergence guarantees under mild conditions.\n  Empirically, on Latin Square constraint satisfaction across 1,078 trials, pressure-field coordination matches hierarchical control (38.2% vs 38.8% aggregate solve rate, p=0.94, indicating statistical equivalence). Both significantly outperform sequential (23.3%), random (11.7%), and conversation-based multi-agent dialogue (8.6%, p<0.00001). Temporal decay is essential: disabling it increases final pressure 49-fold (d=4.15). On easy problems, pressure-field achieves 87% solve rate. The approach maintains consistent performance from 2 to 32 agents. Our key finding: implicit coordination through shared pressure gradients achieves parity with explicit hierarchical control while dramatically outperforming explicit dialogue-based coordination. This suggests that constraint-driven emergence offers a simpler, equally effective foundation for multi-agent AI."}

We present an exploratory study of how user expectations form and evolve when agent personality is made dynamically adjustable. To investigate this, we designed a prototype conversational interface that enabled users to adjust an agent's personality along eight research-grounded dimensions across three task contexts: informational, emotional, and appraisal. We conducted an online mixed-methods study with 60 participants, employing latent profile analysis to characterize personality classes and trajectory analysis to trace evolving patterns of personality adjustment. These approaches revealed distinct personality profiles at initial and final configuration stages, and adjustment trajectories, shaped by context-sensitivity. Participants also valued the autonomy, perceived the agent as more anthropomorphic, and reported greater trust. Our findings highlight the importance of designing conversational agents that adapt alongside their users, advancing more responsive and human-centred AI."}

To reduce the dominant prefill cost in such pipelines, recent work advocates KV cache reuse across partially shared contexts and reports substantial speedups for generation agents. In this work, we show that these efficiency gains do not transfer uniformly to judge-centric inference. Across GSM8K, MMLU, and HumanEval, we find that reuse strategies that are effective for execution agents can severely perturb judge behavior: end-task accuracy may appear stable, yet the judge's selection becomes highly inconsistent with dense prefill. We quantify this risk using Judge Consistency Rate (JCR) and provide diagnostics showing that reuse systematically weakens cross-candidate attention, especially for later candidate blocks. Our ablation further demonstrates that explicit cross-candidate interaction is crucial for preserving dense-prefill decisions. Overall, our results identify a previously overlooked failure mode of KV cache reuse and highlight judge-centric inference as a distinct regime that demands dedicated, risk-aware system design."}

In this study we investigate the spatiotemporal structure of electrical potential dynamics in oyster mushroom (\\textit{Pleurotus ostreatus}) mycelium colonising a wood-shavings substrate. Electrical signals were recorded using an eight-channel star-shaped differential electrode array providing angular resolution around a central region of colonised substrate. We analyse spike statistics, bursting behaviour, inter-channel correlations, and event-based propagation delays. The results reveal strong directional heterogeneity in spiking frequency and amplitude, clustered bursting dynamics, partial and localised coupling between channels, and reproducible propagation patterns across spatial sectors. Electrical bursts originate preferentially in specific directions and recruit other regions with with characteristic delays ranging from seconds to minutes to hours. These findings support the interpretation of fungal mycelium as a spatially extended excitable medium capable of slow, distributed electrical signalling and signal integration."}

However, the sensitive use case of mental health demands thoughtful integration with mental health concepts and a comprehensive understanding of prior literature. This paper presents a scoping literature review of the ISMAR, IEEEVR, and TVCG communities to assess the contributions of the XR community to the mental health serious game domain and explore potential weaknesses and strengths for future work by XR researchers. To this end, this review identified 204 possibly relevant articles in the XR community and fully evaluated 6 XR serious games for mental health. This relatively small number of articles for final inclusion suggests that XR mental health serious games are largely underexplored by the XR community (or not reported within the XR community). There is value in exploring the existing literature space as it is. Thus, this paper evaluates these six papers in terms of game elements and underlying psychological foundations, and discuss future directions for XR researchers in this wide-open research space within our community."}

Modern agent protocols standardize connectivity and interoperability; yet, none provide formal, resource governance-normative mechanisms to bound how much agents may consume or how long they may operate. We introduce Agent Contracts, a formal framework that extends the contract metaphor from task allocation to resource-bounded execution. An Agent Contract unifies input/output specifications, multi-dimensional resource constraints, temporal boundaries, and success criteria into a coherent governance mechanism with explicit lifecycle semantics. For multi-agent coordination, we establish conservation laws ensuring delegated budgets respect parent constraints, enabling hierarchical coordination through contract delegation. Empirical validation across four experiments demonstrates 90% token reduction with 525x lower variance in iterative workflows, zero conservation violations in multi-agent delegation, and measurable quality-resource tradeoffs through contract modes. Agent Contracts provide formal foundations for predictable, auditable, and resource-bounded autonomous AI deployment."}

Recent advances in natural language processing and agentic AI offer ways to improve how organizations share and use data. But many barriers remain. Today's tools require technical skills and multiple roles to discover, request, and query data. Automating data access using enterprise AI agents is limited by the means to discover and autonomously access distributed data. Current solutions either compromise governance or break agentic workflows through manual approvals. To close this gap, we introduce Data Product MCP integrated in a data product marketplace. This data marketplace, already in use at large enterprises, enables AI agents to find, request, and query enterprise data products while enforcing data contracts in real time without lowering governance standards. The system is built on the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and links the AI-driven marketplace with cloud platforms such as Snowflake, Databricks, and Google Cloud Platform. It supports semantic discovery of data products based on business context, automates access control by validating generated queries against approved business purposes using AI-driven checks, and enforces contracts in real time by blocking unauthorized queries before they run. We assessed the system with feedback from $n=16$ experts in data governance. Our qualitative evaluation demonstrates effectiveness through enterprise scenarios such as customer analytics. The findings suggest that Data Product MCP reduces the technical burden for data analysis without weakening governance, filling a key gap in enterprise AI adoption."}

MLLM-VADStory segments ads into functional units, classifies each unit's functionality using a novel advertising-specific functional role taxonomy, and then aggregates functional sequences across ads to recover data-driven storyline structures. Applying the framework to 50k social media video ads across four industry subverticals, we find that story-based creatives improve video retention, and we recommend top-performing story arcs to guide advertisers in creative design.

However, few studies have linked personality to observable search behaviors. This study aims to characterize personality traits through a multimodal time-series model that integrates eye-tracking data and gaze missingness-periods when the user's gaze is not captured. This approach is based on the idea that people often look away when they think, signaling disengagement or reflection. We conducted a user study with 25 participants, who used an interactive application on an iPad, allowing them to engage with digital artifacts from a museum. We rely on raw gaze data from an eye tracker, minimizing preprocessing so that behavioral patterns can be preserved without substantial data cleaning. From this perspective, we trained models to predict personality traits using gaze signals. Our results from a five-fold cross-validation study demonstrate strong predictive performance across all five dimensions: Neuroticism (Macro F1 = 77.69%), Conscientiousness (74.52%), Openness (77.52%), Agreeableness (73.09%), and Extraversion (76.69%). The ablation study examines whether the absence of gaze information affects the model performance, demonstrating that incorporating missingness improves multimodal time-series modeling. The full model, which integrates both time-series signals and missingness information, achieves 10-15% higher accuracy and macro F1 scores across all Big Five traits compared to the model without time-series signals and missingness. These findings provide evidence that personality can be inferred from search-related gaze behavior and demonstrate the value of incorporating missing gaze data into time-series multimodal modeling."}

Recent advances in generative AI suggest a new paradigm: what if editing a video were as straightforward as rewriting text? To investigate this, we present a tech probe and a study on text-driven video reauthoring. Our approach involves two technical contributions: (1) a generative reconstruction algorithm that reverse-engineers video into an editable text prompt, and (2) an interactive probe, Rewrite Kit, that allows creators to manipulate these prompts. A technical evaluation of the algorithm reveals a critical human-AI perceptual gap. A probe study with 12 creators surfaced novel use cases such as virtual reshooting, synthetic continuity, and aesthetic restyling. It also highlighted key tensions around coherence, control, and creative alignment in this new paradigm.
