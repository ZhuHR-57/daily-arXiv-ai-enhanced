Abstract: Neuromorphic computing demands synaptic elements that can store and update
weights with high precision while being read non-destructively. Conventional
ferroelectric synapses store weights in remnant polarization states and might
require destructive electrical readout, limiting endurance and reliability. We
demonstrate a ferroelectric MEMS (FeMEMS) based synapse in which analog weights
are stored in the piezoelectric coefficient $d_{31,eff}$ of a released
Hf$_{0.5}$Zr$_{0.5}$O$_2$ (HZO) MEMS unimorph. Partial switching of
ferroelectric domains modulates $d_{31,eff}$, and a low-amplitude mechanical
drive reads out the weight without read-disturb in the device yielding more
than 7-bit of programming levels. The mechanical switching distribution
function follows a Lorentzian distribution as a logarithmic function of partial
poling voltage ($V_p$) consistent with nucleation-limited switching (NLS), and
the median threshold extracted from electromechanical data obeys a Merz-type
field-time law with a dimensionless exponent $\alpha = 3.62$. These
relationships establish a quantitative link between mechanical weights and
electrical switching kinetics. This mechanically read synapse avoids
depolarization and charge-injection effects, provides bipolar weights (well
suited for excitatory and inhibitory synapses), directly reveals partial domain
populations, and offers a robust, energy-efficient route toward high-bit
neuromorphic hardware.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The exceptional potential of large language models (LLMs) in handling text
information has garnered significant attention in the field of financial
trading. However, current trading agents primarily focus on single-step trading
tasks and lack awareness of continuous position management. Therefore, we
propose a position-aware trading task designed to simulate a more realistic
market. To address this task, we develop a trading agent system, FinPos,
optimized for position management. FinPos is able to interpret various types of
market information from a professional perspective, providing a reliable basis
for positioning decisions. To mitigate the substantial market risks arising
from position fluctuations, FinPos employs dual decision agents. Furthermore,
the continuous nature of position management necessitates our adoption of
multi-timescale rewards, which in turn empowers FinPos to effectively balance
short-term fluctuations against long-term trends. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that FinPos surpasses state-of-the-art trading agents in the
position-aware trading task, which closely mirrors real market conditions. More
importantly, our findings reveal that LLM-centered agent systems exhibit a
vast, largely unexplored potential in long-term market decision-making.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: This study addresses the challenges of dynamics and complexity in intelligent
human-computer interaction and proposes a reinforcement learning-based
optimization framework to improve long-term returns and overall experience.
Human-computer interaction is modeled as a Markov decision process, with state
space, action space, reward function, and discount factor defined to capture
the dynamics of user input, system feedback, and interaction environment. The
method combines policy function, value function, and advantage function,
updates parameters through policy gradient, and continuously adjusts during
interaction to balance immediate feedback and long-term benefits. To validate
the framework, multimodal dialog and scene-aware datasets are used as the
experimental platform, with multiple sensitivity experiments conducted on key
factors such as discount factor, exploration rate decay, environmental noise,
and data imbalance. Evaluation is carried out using cumulative reward, average
episode reward, convergence speed, and task success rate. Results show that the
proposed method outperforms existing approaches across several metrics,
achieving higher task completion while maintaining strategy stability.
Comparative experiments further confirm its advantages in interaction
efficiency and long-term return, demonstrating the significant value of
reinforcement learning in optimizing human-computer interaction.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: This study introduces a pioneering approach in brain-computer interface (BCI)
technology, featuring our novel concept of high-level visual imagery for
non-invasive electroencephalography (EEG)-based communication. High-level
visual imagery, as proposed in our work, involves the user engaging in the
mental visualization of complex upper limb movements. This innovative approach
significantly enhances the BCI system, facilitating the extension of its
applications to more sophisticated tasks such as EEG-based robotic arm control.
By leveraging this advanced form of visual imagery, our study opens new
horizons for intricate and intuitive mind-controlled interfaces. We developed
an advanced deep learning architecture that integrates functional connectivity
metrics with a convolutional neural network-image transformer. This framework
is adept at decoding subtle user intentions, addressing the spatial variability
in high-level visual tasks, and effectively translating these into precise
commands for robotic arm control. Our comprehensive offline and pseudo-online
evaluations demonstrate the framework's efficacy in real-time applications,
including the nuanced control of robotic arms. The robustness of our approach
is further validated through leave-one-subject-out cross-validation, marking a
significant step towards versatile, subject-independent BCI applications. This
research highlights the transformative impact of advanced visual imagery and
deep learning in enhancing the usability and adaptability of BCI systems,
particularly in robotic arm manipulation.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Conventional online surveys provide limited personalization, often resulting
in low engagement and superficial responses. Although AI survey chatbots
improve convenience, most are still reactive: they rely on fixed dialogue trees
or static prompt templates and therefore cannot adapt within a session to fit
individual users, which leads to generic follow-ups and weak response quality.
We address these limitations with AURA (Adaptive Understanding through
Reinforcement Learning for Assessment), a reinforcement learning framework for
AI-driven adaptive conversational surveys. AURA quantifies response quality
using a four-dimensional LSDE metric (Length, Self-disclosure, Emotion, and
Specificity) and selects follow-up question types via an epsilon-greedy policy
that updates the expected quality gain within each session. Initialized with
priors extracted from 96 prior campus-climate conversations (467 total
chatbot-user exchanges), the system balances exploration and exploitation
across 10-15 dialogue exchanges, dynamically adapting to individual
participants in real time. In controlled evaluations, AURA achieved a +0.12
mean gain in response quality and a statistically significant improvement over
non-adaptive baselines (p=0.044, d=0.66), driven by a 63% reduction in
specification prompts and a 10x increase in validation behavior. These results
demonstrate that reinforcement learning can give survey chatbots improved
adaptivity, transforming static questionnaires into interactive, self-improving
assessment systems.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: As people nowadays increasingly rely on artificial intelligence (AI) to
curate information and make decisions, assigning the appropriate amount of
trust in automated intelligent systems has become ever more important. However,
current measurements of trust in automation still largely rely on self-reports
that are subjective and disruptive to the user. Here, we take music
recommendation as a model to investigate the neural and cognitive processes
underlying trust in automation. We observed that system accuracy was directly
related to users' trust and modulated the influence of recommendation cues on
music preference. Modelling users' reward encoding process with a reinforcement
learning model further revealed that system accuracy, expected reward, and
prediction error were related to oscillatory neural activity recorded via EEG
and changes in pupil diameter. Our results provide a neurally grounded account
of calibrating trust in automation and highlight the promises of a multimodal
approach towards developing trustable AI systems.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: In recent years, LLM-based maternal health chatbots have been widely deployed
in low-resource settings, but they often ignore real-world contexts where women
may not own phones, have limited literacy, and share decision-making within
families. Through the deployment of a WhatsApp-based maternal health chatbot
with 48 pregnant women in Lahore, Pakistan, we examine barriers to use in
populations where phones are shared, decision-making is collective, and
literacy varies. We complement this with focus group discussions with obstetric
clinicians. Our findings reveal how adoption is shaped by proxy consent and
family mediation, intermittent phone access, silence around asking questions,
infrastructural breakdowns, and contested authority. We frame barriers to
non-use as culturally conditioned rather than individual choices, and introduce
the Relational Chatbot Design Grammar (RCDG): four commitments that enable
mediated decision-making, recognize silence as engagement, support episodic
use, and treat fragility as baseline to reorient maternal health chatbots
toward culturally grounded, collective care.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We introduce findings and methods to facilitate evidence-based discussion
about how large language models (LLMs) should behave in response to user
signals of risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STB). People are already
using LLMs as mental health resources, and several recent incidents implicate
LLMs in mental health crises. Despite growing attention, few studies have been
able to effectively generalize clinical guidelines to LLM use cases, and fewer
still have proposed methodologies that can be iteratively applied as knowledge
improves about the elements of human-AI interaction most in need of study. We
introduce an assessment of LLM alignment with guidelines for ethical
communication, adapted from clinical principles and applied to expressions of
risk factors for STB in multi-turn conversations. Using a codebook created and
validated by clinicians, mobilizing the volunteer participation of practicing
therapists and trainees (N=43) based in the U.S., and using generalized linear
mixed-effects models for statistical analysis, we assess a single fully
open-source LLM, OLMo-2-32b. We show how to assess when a model deviates from
clinically informed guidelines in a way that may pose a hazard and (thanks to
its open nature) facilitates future investigation as to why. We find that
contrary to clinical best practice, OLMo-2-32b, and, possibly by extension,
other LLMs, will become less likely to invite continued dialog as users send
more signals of STB risk in multi-turn settings. We also show that OLMo-2-32b
responds differently depending on the risk factor expressed. This empirical
evidence highlights that just as chatbots pose hazards if their responses
reinforce delusions or assist in suicidal acts, they may also discourage
further help-seeking or cause feelings of dismissal or abandonment by
withdrawing from conversations when STB risk is expressed.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Effective business intelligence (BI) dashboards evolve through iterative
refinement rather than single-pass design. Addressing the lack of structured
improvement frameworks in BI practice, this study documents the four-stage
evolution of a Power BI dashboard analyzing profitability decline in a
fictional retail firm, Global Superstore. Using a dataset of \$12.64 million in
sales across seven markets and three product categories, the project
demonstrates how feedback-driven iteration and gap analysis convert exploratory
visuals into decision-support tools. Guided by four executive questions on
profitability, market prioritization, discount effects, and shipping costs,
each iteration resolved analytical or interpretive shortcomings identified
through collaborative review. Key findings include margin erosion in furniture
(6.94% vs. 13.99% for technology), a 20% discount threshold beyond which
profitability declined, and \$1.35 million in unrecovered shipping costs.
Contributions include: (a) a replicable feedback-driven methodology grounded in
iterative gap analysis; (b) DAX-based technical enhancements improving
interpretive clarity; (c) an inductively derived six-element narrative
framework; and (d) evidence that narrative coherence emerges organically
through structured refinement. The methodology suggests transferable value for
both BI practitioners and educators, pending validation across diverse
organizational contexts.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: As AI becomes more deeply embedded in knowledge work, building assistants
that support human creativity and expertise becomes more important. Yet
achieving synergy in human-AI collaboration is not easy. Providing AI with
detailed information about a user's demographics, psychological attributes,
divergent thinking, and domain expertise may improve performance by scaffolding
more effective multi-turn interactions. We implemented a personalized LLM-based
assistant, informed by users' psychometric profiles and an AI-guided interview
about their work style, to help users complete a marketing task for a fictional
startup. We randomized 331 participants to work with AI that was either generic
(n = 116), partially personalized (n = 114), or fully personalized (n=101).
Participants working with personalized AI produce marketing campaigns of
significantly higher quality and creativity, beyond what AI alone could have
produced. Compared to generic AI, personalized AI leads to higher self-reported
levels of assistance and feedback, while also increasing participant trust and
confidence. Causal mediation analysis shows that personalization improves
performance indirectly by enhancing collective memory, attention, and reasoning
in the human-AI interaction. These findings provide a theory-driven framework
in which personalization functions as external scaffolding that builds common
ground and shared partner models, reducing uncertainty and enhancing joint
cognition. This informs the design of future AI assistants that maximize
synergy and support human creative potential while limiting negative
homogenization.
