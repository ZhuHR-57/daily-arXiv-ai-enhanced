Abstract: Ad-hoc teamwork (AHT) requires agents to infer the behavior of previously unseen teammates and adapt their policy accordingly. Conventional approaches often rely on fixed probabilistic models or classifiers, which can be brittle under partial observability and limited interaction. Large language models (LLMs) offer a flexible alternative: by mapping short behavioral traces into high-level hypotheses, they can serve as world models over teammate behavior. We introduce \Collab, a language-based framework that classifies partner types using a behavior rubric derived from trajectory features, and extend it to \ReCollab, which incorporates retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to stabilize inference with exemplar trajectories. In the cooperative Overcooked environment, \Collab effectively distinguishes teammate types, while \ReCollab consistently improves adaptation across layouts, achieving Pareto-optimal trade-offs between classification accuracy and episodic return. These findings demonstrate the potential of LLMs as behavioral world models for AHT and highlight the importance of retrieval grounding in challenging coordination settings.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: In this paper, we plan missions for a fleet of agents in undirected graphs, such as grids, with multiple goals. In contrast to regular multi-agent path-finding, the solver finds and updates the assignment of goals to the agents on its own. In the continuous case for a point agent with motions in the Euclidean plane, the problem can be solved arbitrarily close to optimal. For discrete variants that incur node and edge conflicts, we show that it can be solved in polynomial time, which is unexpected, since traditional vehicle routing on general graphs is NP-hard. We implement a corresponding planner that finds conflict-free optimized routes for the agents. Global assignment strategies greatly reduce the number of conflicts, with the remaining ones resolved by elaborating on the concept of ants-on-the-stick, by solving local assignment problems, by interleaving agent paths, and by kicking agents that have already arrived out of their destinations

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as automated tutors to address educator shortages; however, they often fail at pedagogical reasoning, frequently validating incorrect student solutions (sycophancy) or providing overly direct answers that hinder learning. We introduce Hierarchical Pedagogical Oversight (HPO), a framework that adapts structured adversarial synthesis to educational assessment. Unlike cooperative multi-agent systems that often drift toward superficial consensus, HPO enforces a dialectical separation of concerns: specialist agents first distill dialogue context, which then grounds a moderated, five-act debate between opposing pedagogical critics. We evaluate this framework on the MRBench dataset of 1,214 middle-school mathematics dialogues. Our 8B-parameter model achieves a Macro F1 of 0.845, outperforming GPT-4o (0.812) by 3.3% while using 20 times fewer parameters. These results establish adversarial reasoning as a critical mechanism for deploying reliable, low-compute pedagogical oversight in resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: We propose Multi Agent Reflective Policy Optimization (MARPO) to alleviate the issue of sample inefficiency in multi agent reinforcement learning. MARPO consists of two key components: a reflection mechanism that leverages subsequent trajectories to enhance sample efficiency, and an asymmetric clipping mechanism that is derived from the KL divergence and dynamically adjusts the clipping range to improve training stability. We evaluate MARPO in classic multi agent environments, where it consistently outperforms other methods.

Abstract: Modern AI systems often comprise multiple learnable components that can be naturally organized as graphs. A central challenge is the end-to-end training of such systems without restrictive architectural or training assumptions. Such tasks fit the theory and approaches of the collaborative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) field. We introduce Reinforcement Networks, a general framework for MARL that organizes agents as vertices in a directed acyclic graph (DAG). This structure extends hierarchical RL to arbitrary DAGs, enabling flexible credit assignment and scalable coordination while avoiding strict topologies, fully centralized training, and other limitations of current approaches. We formalize training and inference methods for the Reinforcement Networks framework and connect it to the LevelEnv concept to support reproducible construction, training, and evaluation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on several collaborative MARL setups by developing several Reinforcement Networks models that achieve improved performance over standard MARL baselines. Beyond empirical gains, Reinforcement Networks unify hierarchical, modular, and graph-structured views of MARL, opening a principled path toward designing and training complex multi-agent systems. We conclude with theoretical and practical directions - richer graph morphologies, compositional curricula, and graph-aware exploration. That positions Reinforcement Networks as a foundation for a new line of research in scalable, structured MARL.

Abstract: Heterogeneity is a fundamental property in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), which is closely related not only to the functional differences of agents, but also to policy diversity and environmental interactions. However, the MARL field currently lacks a rigorous definition and deeper understanding of heterogeneity. This paper systematically discusses heterogeneity in MARL from the perspectives of definition, quantification, and utilization. First, based on an agent-level modeling of MARL, we categorize heterogeneity into five types and provide mathematical definitions. Second, we define the concept of heterogeneity distance and propose a practical quantification method. Third, we design a heterogeneity-based multi-agent dynamic parameter sharing algorithm as an example of the application of our methodology. Case studies demonstrate that our method can effectively identify and quantify various types of agent heterogeneity. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm, compared to other parameter sharing baselines, has better interpretability and stronger adaptability. The proposed methodology will help the MARL community gain a more comprehensive and profound understanding of heterogeneity, and further promote the development of practical algorithms.

Abstract: As autonomous vehicle technology advances, ensuring the safety and reliability of these systems becomes paramount. Consequently, comprehensive testing methodologies are essential to evaluate the performance of autonomous vehicles in diverse and complex real-world scenarios. This study focuses on the behaviour coverage analysis of a multi-agent system simulation designed for autonomous vehicle testing, and provides a systematic approach to measure and assess behaviour coverage within the simulation environment. By defining a set of driving scenarios, and agent interactions, we evaluate the extent to which the simulation encompasses a broad range of behaviours relevant to autonomous driving.
  Our findings highlight the importance of behaviour coverage in validating the effectiveness and robustness of autonomous vehicle systems. Through the analysis of behaviour coverage metrics and coverage-based testing, we identify key areas for improvement and optimization in the simulation framework. Thus, a Model Predictive Control (MPC) pedestrian agent is proposed, where its objective function is formulated to encourage \textit{interesting} tests while promoting a more realistic behaviour than other previously studied pedestrian agents. This research contributes to advancing the field of autonomous vehicle testing by providing insights into the comprehensive evaluation of system behaviour in simulated environments. The results offer valuable implications for enhancing the safety, reliability, and performance of autonomous vehicles through rigorous testing methodologies.

Abstract: Emotions are one of the important components of the human being, thus they are a valuable part of daily activities such as interaction with people, decision making and learning. For this reason, it is important to detect, recognize and understand emotions using computational systems to improve communication between people and machines, which would facilitate the ability of computers to understand the communication between humans. This study proposes the creation of a model that allows the classification of people's emotions based on their EEG signals, for which the brain-computer interface EMOTIV EPOC was used. This allowed the collection of electroencephalographic information from 50 people, all of whom were shown audiovisual resources that helped to provoke the desired mood. The information obtained was stored in a database for the generation of the model and the corresponding classification analysis. Random Forest model was created for emotion prediction (happiness, sadness and relaxation), based on the signals of any person. The results obtained were 97.21% accurate for happiness, 76% for relaxation and 76% for sadness. Finally, the model was used to generate a real-time emotion prediction algorithm; it captures the person's EEG signals, executes the generated algorithm and displays the result on the screen with the help of images representative of each emotion.

Abstract: With the significant increase in enrollment in computing-related programs over the past 20 years, lecture sizes have grown correspondingly. In large lectures, instructors face challenges on identifying students' knowledge gaps timely, which is critical for effective teaching. Existing classroom response systems rely on instructor-initiated interactions, which limits their ability to capture the spontaneous knowledge gaps that naturally emerge during lectures. With the widespread adoption of LLMs among students, we recognize these student-AI dialogues as a valuable, student-centered data source for identifying knowledge gaps. In this idea paper, we propose QueryQuilt, a multi-agent LLM framework that automatically detects common knowledge gaps in large-scale lectures by analyzing students' chat logs with AI assistants. QueryQuilt consists of two key components: (1) a Dialogue Agent that responds to student questions while employing probing questions to reveal underlying knowledge gaps, and (2) a Knowledge Gap Identification Agent that systematically analyzes these dialogues to identify knowledge gaps across the student population. By generating frequency distributions of identified gaps, instructors can gain comprehensive insights into class-wide understanding. Our evaluation demonstrates promising results, with QueryQuilt achieving 100% accuracy in identifying knowledge gaps among simulated students and 95% completeness when tested on real student-AI dialogue data. These initial findings indicate the system's potential for facilitate teaching in authentic learning environments. We plan to deploy QueryQuilt in actual classroom settings for comprehensive evaluation, measuring its detection accuracy and impact on instruction.

Abstract: Lowering the barriers to computer programming requires understanding how to scaffold learning. Parsons problems, which require learners to drag-and-drop blocks of code into the correct order and indentation, are proving to be beneficial for scaffolding learning how to write code from scratch. But little is known about the ability of other problem types to do so. This study explores learners' perceptions of a new programming environment called Codespec, which was developed to make computer programming more accessible and equitable by offering multiple means of engagement. Retrospective think-aloud interviews were conducted with nine programmers who were given the choice between Faded Parsons and Pseudocode Parsons problems as optional scaffolding toward solving write-code problems. The results showed that offering Faded and Pseudocode Parsons problems as optional scaffolds supported comprehension monitoring, strategy formation, and refinement of prior knowledge. Learners selectively used Faded Parsons problems for syntax/structure and Pseudocode Parsons problems for high-level reasoning. The costs noted included the time it takes to drag-and-drop the blocks and the confusion experienced when a solution diverges from a learners' mental model. Faded Parsons problems were also perceived as a desirable challenge. This study contributes to the field of computing education and human-computer interaction by extending the functionality of problem spaces that support Parsons problems and by providing empirical evidence of the effectiveness of using other problem types as scaffolding techniques.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Decoding fine-grained movement from non-invasive surface Electromyography (sEMG) is a challenge for prosthetic control due to signal non-stationarity and low signal-to-noise ratios. Generic self-supervised learning (SSL) frameworks often yield suboptimal results on sEMG as they attempt to reconstruct noisy raw signals and lack the inductive bias to model the cylindrical topology of electrode arrays. To overcome these limitations, we introduce SPECTRE, a domain-specific SSL framework. SPECTRE features two primary contributions: a physiologically-grounded pre-training task and a novel positional encoding. The pre-training involves masked prediction of discrete pseudo-labels from clustered Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) representations, compelling the model to learn robust, physiologically relevant frequency patterns. Additionally, our Cylindrical Rotary Position Embedding (CyRoPE) factorizes embeddings along linear temporal and annular spatial dimensions, explicitly modeling the forearm sensor topology to capture muscle synergies. Evaluations on multiple datasets, including challenging data from individuals with amputation, demonstrate that SPECTRE establishes a new state-of-the-art for movement decoding, significantly outperforming both supervised baselines and generic SSL approaches. Ablation studies validate the critical roles of both spectral pre-training and CyRoPE. SPECTRE provides a robust foundation for practical myoelectric interfaces capable of handling real-world sEMG complexities.

Abstract: Clinical electroencephalography is routinely used to evaluate patients with diverse and often overlapping neurological conditions, yet interpretation remains manual, time-intensive, and variable across experts. While automated EEG analysis has been widely studied, most existing methods target isolated diagnostic problems, particularly seizure detection, and provide limited support for multi-disorder clinical screening.
  This study examines automated EEG-based classification across eleven clinically relevant neurological disorder categories, encompassing acute time-critical conditions, chronic neurocognitive and developmental disorders, and disorders with indirect or weak electrophysiological signatures. EEG recordings are processed using a standard longitudinal bipolar montage and represented through a multi-domain feature set capturing temporal statistics, spectral structure, signal complexity, and inter-channel relationships. Disorder-aware machine learning models are trained under severe class imbalance, with decision thresholds explicitly calibrated to prioritize diagnostic sensitivity.
  Evaluation on a large, heterogeneous clinical EEG dataset demonstrates that sensitivity-oriented modeling achieves recall exceeding 80% for the majority of disorder categories, with several low-prevalence conditions showing absolute recall gains of 15-30% after threshold calibration compared to default operating points. Feature importance analysis reveals physiologically plausible patterns consistent with established clinical EEG markers.
  These results establish realistic performance baselines for multi-disorder EEG classification and provide quantitative evidence that sensitivity-prioritized automated analysis can support scalable EEG screening and triage in real-world clinical settings.

Abstract: Data that contextualizes student interactions with online learning systems can be challenging to obtain. This study looks at the rhetorical strategies of a novel method for conducting in-the-moment Data-Driven Classroom Interviews (DDCIs). By using Ordered Network Analysis (ONA) to reanalyze data from Wei et al.'s (2025) Epistemic Network Analysis, we better account for the sequences in which these rhetorical strategies emerge during the interview process. Specifically, we examine how five rhetorical strategies by interviewers relate to five possible rhetorical strategies used in student responses. As with the previous study, results demonstrate minor differences in how students with high and low situational interest respond. Namely, whereas students with high situational interest show moderately higher levels of enthusiasm, students with low situational interest are more likely to respond to interviewers with an explanation. However, overall this study confirms that there are few interviewer-driven differences in these interviews, and it documents that interviewers are following guidelines to rely upon open-ended questions

Abstract: Web-based agents powered by large language models are increasingly used for tasks such as email management or professional networking. Their reliance on dynamic web content, however, makes them vulnerable to prompt injection attacks: adversarial instructions hidden in interface elements that persuade the agent to divert from its original task. We introduce the Task-Redirecting Agent Persuasion Benchmark (TRAP), an evaluation for studying how persuasion techniques misguide autonomous web agents on realistic tasks. Across six frontier models, agents are susceptible to prompt injection in 25\% of tasks on average (13\% for GPT-5 to 43\% for DeepSeek-R1), with small interface or contextual changes often doubling success rates and revealing systemic, psychologically driven vulnerabilities in web-based agents. We also provide a modular social-engineering injection framework with controlled experiments on high-fidelity website clones, allowing for further benchmark expansion.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in complex knowledge work, yet linear transcript interfaces limit support for reflection. Schon's Reflective Practice distinguishes between reflection-in-action (during a task) and reflection-on-action (after a task), both benefiting from non-linear, revisitable representations of dialogue. ChatGraPhT is an interactive tool that shows dialogue as a visual map, allowing users to branch and merge ideas, edit past messages, and receive guidance that prompts deeper reflection. It supports non-linear, multi-path dialogue, while two agentic LLM assistants provide moment-to-moment and higher-level guidance. Our inquiry suggests that keeping the conversation structure visible, allowing branching and merging, and suggesting patterns or ways to combine ideas deepened user reflective engagement. Contributions are: (1) the design of a node-link, agentic LLM interface for reflective dialogue, and (2) transferable design knowledge on balancing structure and AI support to sustain reflection in complex, open-ended tasks.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: While millimeter-wave (mmWave) presents advantages for Human Pose Estimation (HPE) through its non-intrusive sensing capabilities, current mmWave-based HPE methods face limitations in two predominant input paradigms: Heatmap and Point Cloud (PC). Heatmap represents dense multi-dimensional features derived from mmWave, but is significantly affected by multipath propagation and hardware modulation noise. PC, a set of 3D points, is obtained by applying the Constant False Alarm Rate algorithm to the Heatmap, which suppresses noise but results in sparse human-related features. To address these limitations, we study the feasibility of providing an alternative input paradigm: Differentiable Physics-driven Human Representation (DIPR), which represents humans as an ensemble of Gaussian distributions with kinematic and electromagnetic parameters. Inspired by Gaussian Splatting, DIPR leverages human kinematic priors and mmWave propagation physics to enhance human features while mitigating non-human noise through two strategies: 1) We incorporate prior kinematic knowledge to initialize DIPR based on the Heatmap and establish multi-faceted optimization objectives, ensuring biomechanical validity and enhancing motion features. 2) We simulate complete mmWave processing pipelines, re-render a new Heatmap from DIPR, and compare it with the original Heatmap, avoiding spurious noise generation due to kinematic constraints overfitting. Experimental results on three datasets with four methods demonstrate that existing mmWave-based HPE methods can easily integrate DIPR and achieve superior performance.

Abstract: Traditional flight computers -- including mechanical "whiz-wheels" (e.g. E6B, CRP series) and electronic flight calculators (e.g. ASA CX-3, Sportys E6-B) -- have long played a central role in flight planning and training within general aviation (GA). While these tools remain pedagogically valuable, their fixed form factors, constrained interaction models, and limited extensibility are increasingly misaligned with the expectations and workflows of pilots operating in modern digital environments.
  This paper presents E6BJA (Jamies Flight Computer), a fully featured, multi-platform, software-based flight computer designed natively for Apple iOS, Android, and Microsoft Windows devices, with a complementary web-based implementation. E6BJA reproduces the core calculations of traditional flight computers while extending them through enhanced modelling capabilities such as the 1976 International Standard Atmosphere, carburettor icing risk estimation, and aircraft-specific weight and balance calculators. Each calculator is accompanied by embedded educational monographs that explain underlying assumptions, variables, and equations.
  We compare E6BJA with mechanical and electronic flight computers across functional, cognitive, and technical dimensions, demonstrating improvements in accuracy, error reduction, discoverability, and educational value. We also discuss design trade-offs associated with native multi-platform development and examine how contemporary mobile computing environments can support safer and more intuitive pre-flight planning for pilots, trainees, instructors, and flight planning personnel. By combining the conceptual rigour of traditional flight planning methods with modern human-computer interaction design, E6BJA represents a meaningful evolution in pilot-facing flight tools, supporting both computation and instruction in aviation training contexts.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its prodromal stage, Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), are associated with subtle declines in memory, attention, and language that often go undetected until late in progression. Traditional diagnostic tools such as MRI and neuropsychological testing are invasive, costly, and poorly suited for population-scale monitoring. Social platforms, by contrast, produce continuous multimodal traces that can serve as ecologically valid indicators of cognition. In this paper, we introduce Cogniscope, a simulation framework that generates social-media-style interaction data for studying digital biomarkers of cognitive health. The framework models synthetic users with heterogeneous trajectories, embedding micro-tasks such as video summarization and lightweight question answering into content consumption streams. These interactions yield linguistic markers (semantic drift, disfluency) and behavioral signals (watch time, pausing, sharing), which can be fused to evaluate early detection models. We demonstrate the framework's use through ablation and sensitivity analyses, showing how detection performance varies across modalities, noise levels, and temporal windows. To support reproducibility, we release the generator code, parameter configurations, and synthetic datasets. By providing a controllable and ethically safe testbed, Cogniscope enables systematic investigation of multimodal cognitive markers and offers the community a benchmark resource that complements real-world validation studies.

Abstract: Space exploration has advanced rapidly, but the emotional needs of astronauts on long-duration missions remain underexplored. We present ReHome Earth, a dual-component design approach addressing space homesickness: 1) a future-oriented installation concept integrating transparent OLED displays with spaceship windows for real-time Earth connectivity, and 2) a functional VR prototype simulating astronaut isolation for testing AI-generated content effectiveness. Since accessing astronauts during missions is impossible, we conducted concept validation with terrestrial participants experiencing geographic displacement. Through evaluation with 84 proxy participants and 6 HCI experts, we demonstrate strong emotional resonance and validate three design implications: emotional pacing mechanisms, explainable biophysical feedback systems, and evolution from individual tools to collective affective infrastructure. Our contributions include a technically feasible space installation concept, a functional VR prototype for space HCI research, and empirical insights into the design of AI-driven emotional support systems for extreme isolation environments.

Abstract: For English as a Foreign Language (EFL) learners, code-switching (CSW), or alternating between their native language and the target language (English), can lower anxiety and ease communication barriers. Large language models (LLMs), with their multilingual abilities, offer new opportunities to support CSW in speaking practice. Yet, the pedagogical design of LLM-based tutors remains underexplored. To this end, we conducted a six-week study of LLM-mediated speaking practice with 20 Korean EFL learners, alongside a qualitative study with nine English teachers who designed and refined responses to learner CSW. Findings show that learners used CSW not only to bridge lexical gaps but also to express cultural and emotional nuance, prompting teachers to employ selective interventions and dynamic scaffolding strategies. We conclude with design implications for bilingual LLM-powered tutors that leverage teachers' expertise to transform CSW into meaningful learning opportunities.

Abstract: Mixed-initiative visual analytics (VA) systems, where human and artificial intelligence (AI) agents collaborate as equal partners during analysis, represented a paradigm shift in human-computer interaction. With recent advances in AI, these systems have seen an increase in sophisticated software agents that have improved task planning, reasoning, and completion capabilities. However, while existing work characterizes agent interplay and communication strategies, there is a limited understanding of the overarching design principles for intelligent agents. Through a systematic review of 90 systems (and 207 unique agents), we propose a design space of intelligent agents comprising six dimensions that collectively characterize an agent's perception, environmental understanding, action capability, and communication strategies. We contribute a novel framework for researchers and designers to explore various design choices for new systems and to situate a system in the current landscape. We conclude with future research opportunities for intelligent agents in mixed-initiative VA systems.

Abstract: The rapid deployment of electric vehicle charging stations (EVCS) within distribution networks necessitates intelligent and adaptive control to maintain the grid's resilience and reliability. In this work, we propose PHANTOM, a physics-aware adversarial network that is trained and optimized through a multi-agent reinforcement learning model. PHANTOM integrates a physics-informed neural network (PINN) enabled by federated learning (FL) that functions as a digital twin of EVCS-integrated systems, ensuring physically consistent modeling of operational dynamics and constraints. Building on this digital twin, we construct a multi-agent RL environment that utilizes deep Q-networks (DQN) and soft actor-critic (SAC) methods to derive adversarial false data injection (FDI) strategies capable of bypassing conventional detection mechanisms. To examine the broader grid-level consequences, a transmission and distribution (T and D) dual simulation platform is developed, allowing us to capture cascading interactions between EVCS disturbances at the distribution level and the operations of the bulk transmission system. Results demonstrate how learned attack policies disrupt load balancing and induce voltage instabilities that propagate across T and D boundaries. These findings highlight the critical need for physics-aware cybersecurity to ensure the resilience of large-scale vehicle-grid integration.

Abstract: Computation in biological neural circuits arises from the interplay of nonlinear temporal responses and spatially distributed dynamic network interactions. Replicating this richness in hardware has remained challenging, as most neuromorphic devices emulate only isolated neuron- or synapse-like functions. In this work, we introduce an integrated neuromorphic computing platform in which both nonlinear spatiotemporal processing and programmable memory are realized within a single perovskite nickelate material system. By engineering symmetric and asymmetric hydrogenated NdNiO3 junction devices on the same wafer, we combine ultrafast, proton-mediated transient dynamics with stable multilevel resistance states. Networks of symmetric NdNiO3 junctions exhibit emergent spatial interactions mediated by proton redistribution, while each node simultaneously provides short-term temporal memory, enabling nanoseconds scale operation with an energy cost of 0.2 nJ per input. When interfaced with asymmetric output units serving as reconfigurable long-term weights, these networks allow both feature transformation and linear classification in the same material system. Leveraging these emergent interactions, the platform enables real-time pattern recognition and achieves high accuracy in spoken-digit classification and early seizure detection, outperforming temporal-only or uncoupled architectures. These results position protonic nickelates as a compact, energy-efficient, CMOS-compatible platform that integrates processing and memory for scalable intelligent hardware.

Abstract: Dynamical Ising machines are continuous dynamical systems that evolve from a generic initial state to a state strongly related to the ground state of the classical Ising model. We show that such a machine driven by the V${}_2$ dynamical model can solve exactly discrete tomography problems about reconstructing a binary image from the pixel sums along a discrete set of rays. In contrast to usual applications of Ising machines, targeting approximate solutions to optimization problems, the randomly initialized V${}_2$ model converges with high probability ($P_{\mathrm{succ}} \approx 1$) to an image precisely satisfying the tomographic data. For the problems with at most two rays intersecting at each pixel, the V${}_2$ model converges in internal machine time that depends only weakly on the image size. Our consideration is an example of how specific dynamical systems can produce exact solutions to highly non-trivial data processing tasks. Crucially, this solving capability arises from the dynamical features of the V${}_2$ model itself, in particular its equations of motion that enable non-local transitions of the discrete component of the relaxed spin beyond Hamming-neighborhood constraints, rather than from merely recasting the tomography problem in spin form.

Abstract: Combinatorial optimization (CO) underpins applications in science and engineering, ranging from logistics to electronic design automation. A classic example is the NP-complete Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). Finding exact solutions for large-scale TSP instances remains computationally intractable; on von Neumann architectures, such solvers are constrained by the memory wall, incurring compute-memory traffic that grows with instance size. Metaheuristics, such as simulated annealing implemented on compute-in-memory (CiM) architectures, offer a way to mitigate the von Neumann bottleneck. This is accomplished by performing in-memory optimization cycles to rapidly find approximate solutions for TSP instances. Yet this approach suffers from degrading solution quality as instance size increases, owing to inefficient state-space exploration. To address this, we present LIMO, a mixed-signal computational macro that implements an in-memory annealing algorithm with reduced search-space complexity. The annealing process is aided by the stochastic switching of spin-transfer-torque magnetic-tunnel-junctions (STT-MTJs) to escape local minima. For large instances, our macro co-design is complemented by a refinement-based divide-and-conquer algorithm amenable to parallel optimization in a spatial architecture. Consequently, our system comprising several LIMO macros achieves superior solution quality and faster time-to-solution on instances up to 85,900 cities compared to prior hardware annealers. The modularity of our annealing peripherals allows the LIMO macro to be reused for other applications, such as vector-matrix multiplications (VMMs). This enables our architecture to support neural network inference. As an illustration, we show image classification and face detection with software-comparable accuracy, while achieving lower latency and energy consumption than baseline CiM architectures.

Abstract: Self-Sovereign Identity is a transformative paradigm in digital identity management, empowering individuals with full control over their credentials. However, the coexistence of diverse SSI ecosystems, such as the European Digital Identity and the European Blockchain Services Infrastructure, poses significant challenges for cross-ecosystem interoperability due to technological and trust framework differences. This paper introduces \textit{interID}, a modular credential verification application that addresses this fragmentation by orchestrating ecosystem-specific verifier services. Our key contributions include: (1) an ecosystem-agnostic orchestration layer that interfaces with multiple SSI verification services, (2) a unified API that abstracts underlying protocol complexities for service providers, and (3) a practical implementation that bridges three major SSI ecosystems: Hyperledger Indy/Aries, EBSI, and EUDI. Evaluation results demonstrate that interID successfully verifies credentials across all tested wallets with minimal performance overhead, while maintaining a flexible architecture that can be extended to accept credentials from additional SSI ecosystems. This work offers both a technical solution and architectural pattern for achieving interoperability in SSI verifier implementations.

Abstract: Motion capture remains costly and complex to deploy, limiting use outside specialized laboratories. We present Mesquite, an open-source, low-cost inertial motion-capture system that combines a body-worn network of 15 IMU sensor nodes with a hip-worn Android smartphone for position tracking. A low-power wireless link streams quaternion orientations to a central USB dongle and a browser-based application for real-time visualization and recording. Built on modern web technologies -- WebGL for rendering, WebXR for SLAM, WebSerial and WebSockets for device and network I/O, and Progressive Web Apps for packaging -- the system runs cross-platform entirely in the browser. In benchmarks against a commercial optical system, Mesquite achieves mean joint-angle error of 2-5 degrees while operating at approximately 5% of the cost. The system sustains 30 frames per second with end-to-end latency under 15ms and a packet delivery rate of at least 99.7% in standard indoor environments. By leveraging IoT principles, edge processing, and a web-native stack, Mesquite lowers the barrier to motion capture for applications in entertainment, biomechanics, healthcare monitoring, human-computer interaction, and virtual reality. We release hardware designs, firmware, and software under an open-source license (GNU GPL).

Abstract: When people listen to music, they often experience rich visual imagery. We aim to externalize this inner imagery by generating images conditioned on music. We propose MESA MIG, a multi agent semantic and emotion aligned framework that first produces structured music captions and then refines them with cooperating agents specializing in scene, motion, style, color, and composition. In parallel, a Valence Arousal regression head predicts continuous affective states from music, while a CLIP based visual VA head estimates emotions from images. These components jointly enforce semantic and emotional alignment between music and synthesized images. Experiments on curated music image pairs show that MESA MIG outperforms caption only and single agent baselines in aesthetic quality, semantic consistency, and VA alignment, and achieves competitive emotion regression performance compared with state of the art music and image emotion models.

Abstract: OpenPBR is a physically based, standardized uber-shader developed for interoperable material authoring and rendering across VFX, animation, and design visualization workflows. This document serves as a companion to the official specification, offering deeper insight into the model's development and more detailed implementation guidance, including code examples and mathematical derivations.
  We begin with a description of the model's formal structure and theoretical foundations - covering slab-based layering, statistical mixing, and microfacet theory - before turning to its physical components. These include metallic, dielectric, subsurface, and glossy-diffuse base substrates, followed by thin-film iridescence, coat, and fuzz layers. A special-case mode for rendering thin-walled objects is also described.
  Additional sections explore technical topics in greater depth, such as the decoupling of specular reflectivity from transmission, the choice of parameterization for subsurface scattering, and the detailed physics of coat darkening and thin-film interference. We also discuss planned extensions, including hazy specular reflection and retroreflection.
