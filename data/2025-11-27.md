Abstract: Ensuring cognitive stability in autonomous multi-agent systems (MAS) is a central challenge for large-scale, distributed AI. While existing observability tools monitor system outputs, they cannot quantify how rapidly agentic workflows recover once reasoning coherence has been lost. We adapt classical reliability metrics-Mean Time-to-Recovery (MTTR), Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF), and related ratios-into the cognitive domain, defining MTTR-A (Mean Time-to-Recovery for Agentic Systems) as a runtime measure of cognitive recovery latency. MTTR-A quantifies the time required for a MAS to detect reasoning drift and restore consistent operation, capturing the recovery of reasoning coherence rather than infrastructural repair.
  A benchmark simulation using the AG~News corpus and the LangGraph orchestration framework was conducted, modeling recovery latencies across multiple reflex modes. Automated reflexes restored stability within approximately 6s on average, while human-approval interventions required about 12s. Across 200 runs, the median simulated MTTR-A was 6.21+-2.14s, MTBF=6.7+-2.14s, and NRR=0.08, demonstrating measurable runtime resilience across reflex strategies.
  By formalizing recovery latency as a quantifiable property of distributed reasoning-and deriving reliability bounds linking recovery time and cognitive uptime-this work establishes a foundation for runtime dependability in agentic cognition, transforming cognitive recovery from an ad-hoc process into a standardized, interpretable performance

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The rapid adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) introduces major challenges for decentralized charging control. Existing decentralized approaches efficiently coordinate a large number of EVs to select charging stations while reducing energy costs, preventing power peak and preserving driver privacy. However, they often struggle under severe contingencies, such as station outages or unexpected surges in charging requests. These situations create competition for limited charging slots, resulting in long queues and reduced driver comfort. To address these limitations, we propose a novel collective learning-based coordination framework that allows EVs to balance individual comfort on their selections against system-wide efficiency, i.e., the overall queues across all stations. In the framework, EVs are recommended for adaptive charging behaviors that shift priority between comfort and efficiency, achieving Pareto-optimal trade-offs under varying station capacities and dynamic spatio-temporal EV distribution. Experiments using real-world data from EVs and charging stations show that the proposed approach outperforms baseline methods, significantly reducing travel and queuing time. The results reveal that, under uncertain charging conditions, EV drivers that behave selfishly or altruistically at the right moments achieve shorter waiting time than those maintaining moderate behavior throughout. Our findings under high fractions of station outages and adversarial EVs further demonstrate improved resilience and trustworthiness of decentralized EV charging infrastructure.

Abstract: This study proposes Tool-RoCo, a novel benchmark for evaluating large language models (LLMs) in long-term multi-agent cooperation based on RoCo, a multi-robot cooperative benchmark. Recent research on LLM-based multi-agent systems has relied on predefined orchestration, while ignoring agent autonomy. Tool-RoCo treats other agents as tools and introduces cooperative tools, leveraging tool usage to evaluate multi-agent cooperation and self-organization. Tool usage means that each agent (LLM) selects a tool from a candidate set based on the current state, receives feedback, and adjusts its selection in subsequent rounds. To evaluate different autonomy levels, we propose four LLM paradigms: (1) centralized cooperation, where a single LLM allocates tools to all agents; (2) centralized self-organization, where a central LLM autonomously activates agents while keeping others inactive; (3) decentralized cooperation, where each agent has its own LLM and calls tools based on local information; and (4) self-organization, where a randomly chosen initial agent can request collaboration, activating additional agents via tool calls. Tool-RoCo includes three multi-robot tasks, SORT, PACK, and CABINET, to measure format and parameter accuracy and agent coordination through tool usage. The results using several LLMs showed that cooperative tools accounted for only 7.09% of all tools, indicating that LLM-based agents rarely invoked others as assistants. Moreover, activation tools accounted for 96.42%, suggesting that current LLMs tend to maintain active agents while seldom deactivating them for adaptive coordination. Tool-RoCo provides a systematic benchmark to evaluate LLM autonomy and cooperation in multi-agent tasks. Code and Demo: https://github.com/ColaZhang22/Tool-Roco

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent systems have emerged as a powerful paradigm for enabling autonomous agents to solve complex tasks. As these systems scale in complexity, cost becomes an important consideration for practical deployment. However, existing work rarely addresses how to structure multi-agent systems under explicit budget constraints. In this paper, we propose BAMAS, a novel approach for building multi-agent systems with budget awareness. BAMAS first selects an optimal set of LLMs by formulating and solving an Integer Linear Programming problem that balances performance and cost. It then determines how these LLMs should collaborate by leveraging a reinforcement learning-based method to select the interaction topology. Finally, the system is instantiated and executed based on the selected agents and their collaboration topology. We evaluate BAMAS on three representative tasks and compare it with state-of-the-art agent construction methods. Results show that BAMAS achieves comparable performance while reducing cost by up to 86%.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Ising machines are emerging as a new technology for solving various classes of computationally hard problems of practical importance, yet their limits on structured SAT workloads, representative of numerous real-world applications, remain unexplored. We present the first systematic study of such problems, using semiprime factorization as a representative case. Our results show that highly restrictive, 'tight' constraints, when mapped into optimization form, fundamentally distort Ising dynamics, and that these distortions are amplified when problems are decomposed to fit within limited hardware. We propose a hybrid approach that offloads constraint-heavy components to classical preprocessing while reserving the computationally challenging part for the Ising machine. Structured SAT represents a crucial step toward real-world applications, which remain out of reach today due to Ising machine limitations. Our findings reveal that constraint handling is a central obstacle and highlight hybrid hardware-software approaches as the path forward to unlocking the long-term potential of Ising machines. We conduct our evaluation on the manufactured Ising chips and demonstrate that our flow more than doubles the solvable problem size on a 45-spin all-to-all Ising chip, from 8-bit (94 variables) to 11-bit (190 variables), without hardware changes.

Abstract: Ferroelectric non-volatile capacitance-based memories enable non-destructive readout and low-power in-memory computing with 3D stacking potential. However, their limited memory window (1-10 fF/μm) requires material-device-circuit co-optimization. Existing compact models fail to capture the physics of small-signal capacitance, device variability, and cycling degradation, which are critical parameters for circuit design. In non-volatile capacitance devices, the small-signal capacitance difference of the polarization states is the key metric. The majority of the reported compact models do not incorporate any physical model of the capacitance as a function of voltage and polarization. We present a physics-based compact model that captures small-signal capacitance, interface and bulk defect contributions, and device variations through multi-scale modeling combining experimental data, TCAD simulations, and circuit validation. Based on this methodology, we show optimized memory read-out with +/- 5 mV sense margin and impact of device endurance at the circuit level. This work presents a comprehensive compact model which enables the design of selector-less arrays and 3D-stacked memories for compute-in-memory and storage memory.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The increasing trust in large language models (LLMs), especially in the form of chatbots, is often undermined by the lack of their extrinsic evaluation. This holds particularly true in nutrition, where randomised controlled trials (RCTs) are the gold standard, and experts demand them for evidence-based deployment. LLMs have shown promising results in this field, but these are limited to intrinsic setups. We address this gap by running the first RCT involving LLMs for nutrition. We augment a rule-based chatbot with two LLM-based features: (1) message rephrasing for conversational variety and engagement, and (2) nutritional counselling through a fine-tuned model. In our seven-week RCT (n=81), we compare chatbot variants with and without LLM integration. We measure effects on dietary outcome, emotional well-being, and engagement. Despite our LLM-based features performing well in intrinsic evaluation, we find that they did not yield consistent benefits in real-world deployment. These results highlight critical gaps between intrinsic evaluations and real-world impact, emphasising the need for interdisciplinary, human-centred approaches.\footnote{We provide all of our code and results at: \\ \href{https://github.com/saeshyra/diet-chatbot-trial}{https://github.com/saeshyra/diet-chatbot-trial}}

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to answer high-stakes study-abroad questions about admissions, visas, scholarships, and eligibility. Yet it remains unclear how reliably they advise students, and how often otherwise helpful answers drift into unsupported claims (``hallucinations'').
  This work provides a clear, domain-grounded overview of how current LLMs behave in this setting. Using realistic questions set drawn from ApplyBoard's advising workflows -- an EdTech platform that supports students from discovery to enrolment -- we evaluate two essentials side by side: accuracy (is the information correct and complete?) and hallucination (does the model add content not supported by the question or domain evidence). These questions are categorized by domain scope which can be a single-domain or multi-domain -- when it must integrate evidence across areas such as admissions, visas, and scholarships.
  To reflect real advising quality, we grade answers with a simple rubric which is correct, partial, or wrong. The rubric is domain-coverage-aware: an answer can be partial if it addresses only a subset of the required domains, and it can be over-scoped if it introduces extra, unnecessary domains; both patterns are captured in our scoring as under-coverage or reduced relevance/hallucination.
  We also report measures of faithfulness and answer relevance, alongside an aggregate hallucination score, to capture relevance and usefulness. All models are tested with the same questions for a fair, head-to-head comparison.
  Our goals are to: (1) give a clear picture of which models are most dependable for study-abroad advising, (2) surface common failure modes -- where answers are incomplete, off-topic, or unsupported, and (3) offer a practical, reusable protocol for auditing LLMs before deployment in education and advising contexts.

Abstract: Programming education often assumes English proficiency and text-based interaction, creating barriers for students from multilingual regions such as India. We present CodeVaani, a multilingual speech-driven assistant for understanding code, built into Bodhitree [1], a Learning Management System developed at IIT Bombay. It is a voice-enabled assistant that helps learners explore programming concepts in their native languages. The system integrates Indic ASR, a codeaware transcription refinement module, and a code model for generating relevant answers. Responses are provided in both text and audio for natural interaction. In a study with 28 beginner programmers, CodeVaani achieved 75% response accuracy, with over 80% of participants rating the experience positively. Compared to classroom assistance, our framework offers ondemand availability, scalability to support many learners, and multilingual support that lowers the entry barrier for students with limited English proficiency. The demo will illustrate these capabilities and highlight how voice-based AI systems can make programming education more inclusive. Supplementary artifacts and demo video are also made available.

Abstract: When creating choropleth maps, mapmakers often bin (i.e., group, classify) quantitative data values into groups to help show that certain areas fall within a similar range of values. For instance, a mapmaker may divide counties into groups of high, middle, and low life expectancy (measured in years). It is well known that different binning methods (e.g., natural breaks, quantile) yield different groupings, meaning the same data can be presented differently depending on how it is divided into bins. To help guide a wide variety of users, we present a new, open source, web-based, geospatial visualization tool, Exploropleth, that lets users interact with a catalog of established data binning methods, and subsequently compare, customize, and export custom maps. This tool advances the state of the art by providing multiple binning methods in one view and supporting administrative unit reclassification on-the-fly. We interviewed 16 cartographers and geographic information systems (GIS) experts from 13 government organizations, non-government organizations (NGOs), and federal agencies who identified opportunities to integrate Exploropleth into their existing mapmaking workflow, and found that the tool has potential to educate students as well as mapmakers with varying levels of experience. Exploropleth is open-source and publicly available at https://exploropleth.github.io.

Abstract: The development of web-based geospatial dashboards for risk analysis and decision support is often challenged by the difficulty in visualization of big, multi-dimensional environmental data, implementation complexity, and limited automation. We introduce a generative AI framework that harnesses Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate the creation of interactive geospatial dashboards from user-defined inputs including UI wireframes, requirements, and data sources. By incorporating a structured knowledge graph, the workflow embeds domain knowledge into the generation process and enable accurate and context-aware code completions. A key component of our approach is the Context-Aware Visual Prompting (CAVP) mechanism, which extracts encodes and interface semantics from visual layouts to guide LLM driven generation of codes. The new framework also integrates a self-validation mechanism that uses an agent-based LLM and Pass@k evaluation alongside semantic metrics to assure output reliability. Dashboard snippets are paired with data visualization codebases and ontological representations, enabling a pipeline that produces scalable React-based completions using the MVVM architectural pattern. Our results demonstrate improved performance over baseline approaches and expanded functionality over third party platforms, while incorporating multi-page, fully functional interfaces. We successfully developed a framework to implement LLMs, demonstrated the pipeline for automated code generation, deployment, and performed chain-of-thought AI agents in self-validation. This integrative approach is guided by structured knowledge and visual prompts, providing an innovative geospatial solution in enhancing risk analysis and decision making.

Abstract: The development of agents with emotional intelligence is becoming increasingly vital due to their significant role in human-computer interaction and the growing integration of computer systems across various sectors of society. Affective computing aims to design intelligent systems that can recognize, evoke, and express human emotions, thereby emulating human emotional intelligence. While previous reviews have focused on specific aspects of this field, there has been limited comprehensive research that encompasses emotion understanding, elicitation, and expression, along with the related challenges. This survey addresses this gap by providing a holistic overview of core components of artificial emotion intelligence. It covers emotion understanding through multimodal data processing, as well as affective cognition, which includes cognitive appraisal, emotion mapping, and adaptive modulation in decision-making, learning, and reasoning. Additionally, it addresses the synthesis of emotional expression across text, speech, and facial modalities to enhance human-agent interaction. This paper identifies and analyzes the key challenges and issues encountered in the development of affective systems, covering state-of-the-art methodologies designed to address them. Finally, we highlight promising future directions, with particular emphasis on the potential of generative technologies to advance affective computing.

Abstract: We present Lattice Menu, a gaze-based marking menu utilizing a lattice of visual anchors that helps perform accurate gaze pointing for menu item selection. Users who know the location of the desired item can leverage target-assisted gaze gestures for multilevel item selection by looking at visual anchors over the gaze trajectories. Our evaluation showed that Lattice Menu exhibits a considerably low error rate (~1%) and a quick menu selection time (1.3-1.6 s) for expert usage across various menu structures (4 x 4 x 4 and 6 x 6 x 6) and sizes (8, 10 and 12°). In comparison with a traditional gaze-based marking menu that does not utilize visual targets, Lattice Menu showed remarkably (~5 times) fewer menu selection errors for expert usage. In a post-interview, all 12 subjects preferred Lattice Menu, and most subjects (8 out of 12) commented that the provisioning of visual targets facilitated more stable menu selections with reduced eye fatigue.

Abstract: Existing research and physical activity guidelines highlight the benefits of outdoor physical activities for ageing populations. There is potential for technology to facilitate outdoor activity through Physical Web infrastructure. We proposed that embedding Physical Web applications that are engaging and interactive in public open spaces as part of interactive wellness parks can encourage older adults to participate in physical activities outdoors and motivate rehabilitation. We have created an initial design prototype based on design requirements generated from a qualitative field study with 24 older adults to explore their perceptions, experiences, and routines of outdoor physical activities. In this paper, we present an initial prototype and findings from a co-design session with 12 older adults, eliciting their feedback on the design and their ideas for future design iterations.

Abstract: The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into video lecture production has the potential to transform higher education by streamlining content creation and enhancing accessibility. This paper investigates a semi automated workflow that combines Google Gemini for script generation, Amazon Polly for voice synthesis, and Microsoft PowerPoint for video assembly. Unlike fully automated text to video platforms, this hybrid approach preserves pedagogical intent while ensuring script to slide synchronization, narrative coherence, and customization. Case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of Gemini in generating accurate and context-sensitive scripts for visually rich academic presentations, while Polly provides natural-sounding narration with controllable pacing. A two course pilot study was conducted to evaluate AI generated instructional videos (AIIV) against human instructional videos (HIV). Both qualitative and quantitative results indicate that AIIVs are comparable to HIVs in terms of learning outcomes, with students reporting high levels of clarity, coherence, and usability. However, limitations remain, particularly regarding audio quality and the absence of human-like avatars. The findings suggest that AI assisted video production can reduce instructor workload, improve scalability, and deliver effective learning resources, while future improvements in synthetic voices and avatars may further enhance learner engagement.

Abstract: To understand how privacy incidents lead to harms, HCI researchers have historically leveraged legal frameworks. However, these frameworks expect acute, tangible harms and thus may not cover the full range of human experience relevant to modern-day digital privacy. To address this gap, our research builds upon these existing frameworks to develop a more comprehensive representation of people's lived experiences with privacy harms. We analyzed 369 privacy incidents reported by individuals from the general public. We found a broader range of privacy incidents and harms than accounted for in existing legal frameworks. The majority of reported privacy harms were not based on tangible harm, but on fear and loss of psychological safety. We also characterize the actors, motives, and information associated with various incidents. This work contributes a new framework for understanding digital privacy harms that can be utilized both in research and practice.

Abstract: We present PileUp, a tufted pile e-textile sensing approach that offers unique affordances through the tactile expressiveness and richness of its continuous, threaded-volume construction. By integrating conductive yarns in looped or cut pile forms, PileUp transforms soft 3-dimensional textiles into multimodal sensors capable of detecting mechanical deformations such as pressure, bending, and strain, as well as environmental conditions like moisture. We propose a design space that outlines the relationships between texture, form factor, and sensing affordances of tufted textiles. We characterize electrical responses under compression, bending, and strain, reporting sensor behaviors. To demonstrate versatility, we present three application scenarios in which PileUp sensors are seamlessly integrated into soft fabrics: a meditation rug with multi-zone sensing, a fleece sleeve that detects arm motion, and a moisture-sensing wall art. Our results establish tufting as an accessible yet expressive fabrication method for creating integrated sensing textiles, distinguishing our work from traditional flat textile sensors.

Abstract: Foundation models are increasingly used to personalize learning, yet many systems still assume fixed curricula or coarse progress signals, limiting alignment with learners' day-to-day needs. At the other extreme, lightweight incidental systems offer flexible, in-the-moment content but rarely guide learners toward mastery. Prior work privileges either continuity (maintaining a plan across sessions) or initiative (reacting to the moment), not both, leaving learners to navigate the trade-off between recency and trajectory-immediate relevance versus cumulative, goal-aligned progress. We present LOOM, an agentic pipeline that infers evolving learner needs from recent LLM conversations and a dynamic learner memory graph, then assembles coherent learning materials personalized to the learner's current needs, priorities, and understanding. These materials link adjacent concepts and surface gaps as tightly scoped modules that cumulatively advance broader goals, providing guidance and sustained progress while remaining responsive to new interests. We describe LOOM's end-to-end architecture and working prototype, including conversation summarization, topic planning, course generation, and graph-based progress tracking. In a formative study with ten participants, users reported that LOOM's generated lessons felt relevant to their recent activities and helped them recognize knowledge gaps, though they also highlighted needs for greater consistency and control. We conclude with design implications for more robust, mixed-initiative learning pipelines that integrate structured learner modelling with everyday LLM interactions.

Abstract: As artificial intelligence systems become increasingly integrated into human social contexts, Artificial Social Intelligence (ASI) has emerged as a critical capability that enables AI to perceive, understand, and engage meaningfully in complex human social interactions. This chapter introduces a comprehensive framework for Human-Centered Artificial Social Intelligence (HC-ASI), built upon the Technology-Human Factors-Ethics (THE) Triangle, which systematically addresses both technical foundations and human-centered design principles necessary for developing socially intelligent AI systems. This chapter provides a comprehensive overview of current ASI research. This chapter begins by establishing the theoretical foundations of ASI, tracing its evolution from classical psychological theories of human social intelligence to contemporary computational models, then examines the mechanisms underlying human-AI social interaction with particular emphasis on establishing shared social understanding and appropriate role positioning. The chapter further explores ASI's practical implications for individuals and groups through comprehensive evaluation frameworks that combine technical benchmarks with human-centered experiential assessments, demonstrating real-world applications through detailed case studies spanning healthcare, companionship, education, and customer service domains. Building on the overview and the framework of HC -ASI, this chapter articulates core HC-ASI design principles and translates them into actionable methodologies and implementation guidelines that provide practical guidance for researchers and practitioners. This chapter concludes with a critical discussion of current challenges and promising directions for developing comprehensive HC-ASI ecosystems.

Abstract: While text entry is an essential and frequent task in Augmented Reality (AR) applications, devising an efficient and easy-to-use text entry method for AR remains an open challenge. This research presents STAR, a smartphone-analogous AR text entry technique that leverages a user's familiarity with smartphone two-thumb typing. With STAR, a user performs thumb typing on a virtual QWERTY keyboard that is overlain on the skin of their hands. During an evaluation study of STAR, participants achieved a mean typing speed of 21.9 WPM (i.e., 56% of their smartphone typing speed), and a mean error rate of 0.3% after 30 minutes of practice. We further analyze the major factors implicated in the performance gap between STAR and smartphone typing, and discuss ways this gap could be narrowed.

Abstract: The paradigm of bare-hand interaction has become increasingly prevalent in Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) environments, propelled by advancements in hand tracking technology. However, a significant challenge arises in delivering haptic feedback to users' hands, due to the necessity for the hands to remain bare. In response to this challenge, recent research has proposed an indirect solution of providing haptic feedback to the forearm. In this work, we present QuadStretcher, a skin stretch display featuring four independently controlled stretching units surrounding the forearm. While achieving rich haptic expression, our device also eliminates the need for a grounding base on the forearm by using a pair of counteracting tactors, thereby reducing bulkiness. To assess the effectiveness of QuadStretcher in facilitating immersive bare-hand experiences, we conducted a comparative user evaluation (n = 20) with a baseline solution, Squeezer. The results confirmed that QuadStretcher outperformed Squeezer in terms of expressing force direction and heightening the sense of realism, particularly in 3-DoF VR interactions such as pulling a rubber band, hooking a fishing rod, and swinging a tennis racket. We further discuss the design insights gained from qualitative user interviews, presenting key takeaways for future forearm-haptic systems aimed at advancing AR/VR bare-hand experiences.

Abstract: Due to age-related declines in memory, processing speed, working memory, and executive functions, older adults experience difficulties in decision making when situations require novel choices, probabilistic judgments, rapid responses, or extensive information search. This study examined whether using generative AI during decision making enhances choice satisfaction and reduces choice difficulty among older adults. A total of 130 participants (younger: 56; older: 74) completed a music-selection task under AI-use and AI-nonuse conditions across two contexts: previously experienced (road trip) and not previously experienced (space travel). In the AI-nonuse condition, participants generated candidate options from memory; in the AI-use condition, GPT-4o presented options tailored to individual preferences. To assess cognitive function, we also administered the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Fourth Edition. Results revealed that in the AI-nonuse condition, older adults with lower cognitive function reported higher choice difficulty and lower choice satisfaction. Under the AI-use condition, choice satisfaction did not change significantly, but perceived choice difficulty decreased significantly in both age groups. Moreover, AI use attenuated the associations observed among older adults between lower cognitive function and both greater difficulty and lower satisfaction. These findings indicate that preference-aligned option recommendations generated by AI can compensate for age-related constraints on information search, thereby reducing perceived choice difficulty without diminishing satisfaction.

Abstract: Millions of users across the globe turn to AI chatbots for their creative needs, inviting widespread interest in understanding how such chatbots represent diverse cultures. At the same time, evaluating cultural representations in open-ended tasks remains challenging and underexplored. In this work, we present TALES, an evaluation of cultural misrepresentations in LLM-generated stories for diverse Indian cultural identities. First, we develop TALES-Tax, a taxonomy of cultural misrepresentations by collating insights from participants with lived experiences in India through focus groups (N=9) and individual surveys (N=15). Using TALES-Tax, we evaluate 6 models through a large-scale annotation study spanning 2,925 annotations from 108 annotators with lived cultural experience from across 71 regions in India and 14 languages. Concerningly, we find that 88\% of the generated stories contain one or more cultural inaccuracies, and such errors are more prevalent in mid- and low-resourced languages and stories based in peri-urban regions in India. Lastly, we transform the annotations into TALES-QA, a standalone question bank to evaluate the cultural knowledge of foundational models. Through this evaluation, we surprisingly discover that models often possess the requisite cultural knowledge despite generating stories rife with cultural misrepresentations.

Abstract: While generative AI systems have gained popularity in diverse applications, their potential to produce harmful outputs limits their trustworthiness and utility. A small but growing line of research has explored tools and processes to better engage non-AI expert users in auditing generative AI systems. In this work, we present the design and evaluation of MIRAGE, a web-based tool exploring a "contrast-first" workflow that allows users to pick up to four different text-to-image (T2I) models, view their images side-by-side, and provide feedback on model performance on a single screen. In our user study with fifteen participants, we used four predefined models for consistency, with only a single model initially being shown. We found that most participants shifted from analyzing individual images to general model output patterns once the side-by-side step appeared with all four models; several participants coined persistent "model personalities" (e.g., cartoonish, saturated) that helped them form expectations about how each model would behave on future prompts. Bilingual participants also surfaced a language-fidelity gap, as English prompts produced more accurate images than Portuguese or Chinese, an issue often overlooked when dealing with a single model. These findings suggest that simple comparative interfaces can accelerate bias discovery and reshape how people think about generative models.

Abstract: Medical AI systems face catastrophic forgetting when deployed in clinical settings, where models must learn new imaging protocols while retaining prior diagnostic capabilities. This challenge is particularly acute for medical vision-language models that must preserve complex cross-modal alignments between medical images and clinical terminology across diverse imaging modalities. We introduce Prompt- Aware Adaptive Elastic Weight Consolidation (PA-EWC), a novel continual learning approach that addresses catastrophic forgetting through prompt-guided parameter specialization. Our method systematically categorizes model parameters based on their functional roles in processing visual-descriptive, spatial-guided, and medical-semantic information, enabling targeted protection of critical knowledge while allowing adaptation to new clinical requirements. PA-EWC incorporates adaptive Fisher Information computation with gradient stability analysis and develops weighted complexity metrics based on medical terminology density. We evaluate our approach across five medical imaging datasets (Kvasir-SEG, ISIC 2018, CheXlocalize, BUSI, CAMUS) representing diverse modalities including endoscopy, dermoscopy, radiography, and ultrasound. Experimental results demonstrate that PA-EWC reduces catastrophic forgetting by up to 17.58% compared to baseline methods, with performance improvements of 4.30% on chest X-ray pathology localization and 6.06% on polyp segmentation.

Abstract: Sound effect editing-modifying audio by adding, removing, or replacing elements-remains constrained by existing approaches that rely solely on low-level signal processing or coarse text prompts, often resulting in limited flexibility and suboptimal audio quality. To address this, we propose AV-Edit, a generative sound effect editing framework that enables fine-grained editing of existing audio tracks in videos by jointly leveraging visual, audio, and text semantics. Specifically, the proposed method employs a specially designed contrastive audio-visual masking autoencoder (CAV-MAE-Edit) for multimodal pre-training, learning aligned cross-modal representations. These representations are then used to train an editorial Multimodal Diffusion Transformer (MM-DiT) capable of removing visually irrelevant sounds and generating missing audio elements consistent with video content through a correlation-based feature gating training strategy. Furthermore, we construct a dedicated video-based sound editing dataset as an evaluation benchmark. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed AV-Edit generates high-quality audio with precise modifications based on visual content, achieving state-of-the-art performance in the field of sound effect editing and exhibiting strong competitiveness in the domain of audio generation.

Abstract: Overdraw is inevitable in large-scale scatterplots. Current scatterplot abstraction methods lose features in medium-to-low density regions. We propose a visual abstraction method designed to provide better feature preservation across arbitrary abstraction levels for large-scale scatterplots, particularly in medium-to-low density regions. The method consists of three closely interconnected steps: first, we partition the scatterplot into iso-density regions and equalize visual density; then, we allocate pixels for different classes within each region; finally, we reconstruct the data distribution based on pixels. User studies, quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that, compared to previous methods, our approach better preserves features and exhibits a special advantage when handling ultra-high dynamic range data distributions.

Abstract: Efficient and scalable 3D surface reconstruction from range data remains a core challenge in computer graphics and vision, particularly in real-time and resource-constrained scenarios. Traditional volumetric methods based on fixed-resolution voxel grids or hierarchical structures like octrees often suffer from memory inefficiency, computational overhead, and a lack of GPU support. We propose a novel variance-adaptive, multi-resolution voxel grid that dynamically adjusts voxel size based on the local variance of signed distance field (SDF) observations. Unlike prior multi-resolution approaches that rely on recursive octree structures, our method leverages a flat spatial hash table to store all voxel blocks, supporting constant-time access and full GPU parallelism. This design enables high memory efficiency and real-time scalability. We further demonstrate how our representation supports GPU-accelerated rendering through a parallel quad-tree structure for Gaussian Splatting, enabling effective control over splat density. Our open-source CUDA/C++ implementation achieves up to 13x speedup and 4x lower memory usage compared to fixed-resolution baselines, while maintaining on par results in terms of reconstruction accuracy, offering a practical and extensible solution for high-performance 3D reconstruction.
