Abstract: In recent years, user generated content (UGC) has become the dominant force in internet traffic. However, UGC videos exhibit a higher degree of variability and diverse characteristics compared to traditional encoding test videos. This variance challenges the effectiveness of data-driven machine learning algorithms for optimizing encoding in the broader context of UGC scenarios. To address this issue, we propose a Tri-Dynamic Preprocessing framework for UGC. Firstly, we employ an adaptive factor to regulate preprocessing intensity. Secondly, an adaptive quantization level is employed to fine-tune the codec simulator. Thirdly, we utilize an adaptive lambda tradeoff to adjust the rate-distortion loss function. Experimental results on large-scale test sets demonstrate that our method attains exceptional performance.

Abstract: Density plots effectively summarize large numbers of points, which would otherwise lead to severe overplotting in, for example, a scatter plot. However, when applied to line-based datasets, such as trajectories or time series, density plots alone are insufficient, as they disrupt path continuity, obscuring smooth trends and rare anomalies. We propose a bin-based illumination model that decouples structure from density to enhance flow and reveal sparse outliers while preserving the original colormap. We introduce a bin-based outlierness metric to rank trajectories. Guided by this ranking, we construct a structural normal map and apply locally-adaptive lighting in the luminance channel to highlight chosen patterns -- from dominant trends to atypical paths -- with acceptable color distortion. Our interactive method enables analysts to prioritize main trends, focus on outliers, or strike a balance between the two. We demonstrate our method on several real-world datasets, showing it reveals details missed by simpler alternatives, achieves significantly lower CIEDE2000 color distortion than standard shading, and supports interactive updates for up to 10,000 lines.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The rapid evolution of the Web toward an agent-centric paradigm, driven by large language models (LLMs), has enabled autonomous agents to reason, plan, and interact in complex decentralized environments. However, the openness and heterogeneity of LLM-based multi-agent systems also amplify the risks of deception, fraud, and misinformation, posing severe challenges to trust establishment and system robustness. To address this issue, we propose Ev-Trust, a strategy-equilibrium trust mechanism grounded in evolutionary game theory. This mechanism integrates direct trust, indirect trust, and expected revenue into a dynamic feedback structure that guides agents' behavioral evolution toward equilibria. Within a decentralized "Request-Response-Payment-Evaluation" service framework, Ev-Trust enables agents to adaptively adjust strategies, naturally excluding malicious participants while reinforcing high-quality collaboration. Furthermore, our theoretical derivation based on replicator dynamics equations proves the existence and stability of local evolutionary equilibria. Experimental results indicate that our approach effectively reflects agent trustworthiness in LLM-driven open service interaction scenarios, reduces malicious strategies, and increases collective revenue. We hope Ev-Trust can provide a new perspective on trust modeling for the agentic service web in group evolutionary game scenarios.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: A wide variety of simple sensors, e.g. for temperature, light, or humidity, is finding its way into smart homes. There are special features to consider with regard to the data collected by these sensors: a) the nature of the measured data as "thin but big data" that needs to be contextualized and interpreted, b) which both algorithms and humans are capable of doing (resulting in comprehensive information in the context of the home, including the recognition of activities, behavior, and health of the residents), and c) uses that lead to interesting positive applications, but also to misuse and implications for privacy. When managing such data, it is necessary to take these special features into account, for which the principles of user experience, human-data interaction, and data protection should be considered together. We present our research tool "Sensorkit" and the participatory research approach used with it to collect sensor data in real homes. In our findings, we present identified challenges and explain how we address them through a) meaningful default settings, b) opportunities for users to interact and intervene, and c) life-cycle management of the data. Important aspects include phases before, during, and after the collection, processing, and use of the sensor data, as well as the provision of user-friendly tools and user involvement. Our findings inform beyond the scope of a research project also the development and use of commercial smart home devices and services.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Non-invasive Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) systems based on electroencephalography (EEG) signals suffer from multiple obstacles to reach a wide adoption in clinical settings for communication or rehabilitation. Among these challenges, the non-stationarity of the EEG signal is a key problem as it leads to various changes in the signal. There are changes within a session, across sessions, and across individuals. Variations over time for a given individual must be carefully managed to improve the BCI performance, including its accuracy, reliability, and robustness over time. This review paper presents and discusses the causes of non-stationarity in the EEG signal, along with its consequences for BCI applications, including covariate shift. The paper reviews recent studies on covariate shift, focusing on methods for detecting and correcting this phenomenon. Signal processing and machine learning techniques can be employed to normalize the EEG signal and address the covariate shift.

Abstract: Social interactions incorporate nonverbal signals to convey emotions alongside speech, including facial expressions and body gestures. Generative models have demonstrated promising results in creating full-body nonverbal animations synchronized with speech; however, evaluations using statistical metrics in 2D settings fail to fully capture user-perceived emotions, limiting our understanding of model effectiveness. To address this, we evaluate emotional 3D animation generative models within a Virtual Reality (VR) environment, emphasizing user-centric metrics emotional arousal realism, naturalness, enjoyment, diversity, and interaction quality in a real-time human-agent interaction scenario. Through a user study (N=48), we examine perceived emotional quality for three state of the art speech-driven 3D animation methods across two emotions happiness (high arousal) and neutral (mid arousal). Additionally, we compare these generative models against real human expressions obtained via a reconstruction-based method to assess both their strengths and limitations and how closely they replicate real human facial and body expressions. Our results demonstrate that methods explicitly modeling emotions lead to higher recognition accuracy compared to those focusing solely on speech-driven synchrony. Users rated the realism and naturalness of happy animations significantly higher than those of neutral animations, highlighting the limitations of current generative models in handling subtle emotional states. Generative models underperformed compared to reconstruction-based methods in facial expression quality, and all methods received relatively low ratings for animation enjoyment and interaction quality, emphasizing the importance of incorporating user-centric evaluations into generative model development. Finally, participants positively recognized animation diversity across all generative models.

Abstract: The growing adoption of generative AI (GenAI) is reshaping how user experience (UX) research teams conduct qualitative research in software development, creating opportunities to streamline the production of qualitative insights. This paper presents findings from two user studies examining how current practices are challenged by GenAI and offering design implications for future AI assistance. Semi-structured interviews with 21 UX researchers, product managers, and designers reveal challenges of aligning AI capabilities with the interpretive, collaborative nature of qualitative research and tensions between roles. UX researchers expressed limited trust in AI-generated results, while product managers often overestimated AI capabilities, amplifying organizational pressures to accelerate research within agile workflows. In a second study, we validated an AI analysis approach more closely aligned with human analysis processes to address trust issues bottoms-up. We outline interaction patterns and design guidelines for responsibly integrating AI into software development cycles.

Abstract: Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) has become increasingly critical due to the rapid deterioration of civil infrastructure. Traditional methods involving heavy equipment are costly and time-consuming. Recent SHM approaches use advanced non-contact sensors, IoT, and Augmented Reality (AR) glasses for faster inspections and immersive experiences during inspections. However, current methods lack quantitative damage data, remote collaboration support, and accurate 3D model alignment with the real structure. Recognizing these current challenges, this paper proposes an AR-based system that integrates Building Information Modelling (BIM) visualization and follows a flexible manipulation approach of 3D holograms to improve structural condition assessments. The proposed framework utilizes the Vuforia software development toolkit to enable the automatic alignment of 3D models to the real structure, ensuring successful model alignment to assist users in accurately visualizing damage locations. The framework also enables flexible manipulation of damage locations, making it easier for users to identify multiple damage points in the 3D models. The system is validated through lab-scale and full-scale bridge use cases, with data transfer performance analyzed under 4G and 5G conditions for remote collaboration. This study demonstrates that the proposed AR-based SHM framework successfully aligns 3D models with real structures, allowing users to manually adjust models and damage locations. The experimental results confirm its feasibility for remote collaborative inspections, highlighting significant improvements with 5G networks. Nevertheless, performance under 4G remains acceptable, ensuring reliability even without 5G coverage.

Abstract: Understanding patients experiences is essential for advancing patient centered care, especially in chronic diseases that require ongoing communication. However, qualitative thematic analysis, the primary approach for exploring these experiences, remains labor intensive, subjective, and difficult to scale. In this study, we developed a multi agent large language model framework that automates qualitative thematic analysis through three agents (Instructor, Thematizer, CodebookGenerator), named Collaborative Theme Identification Agent (CoTI). We applied CoTI to 12 heart failure patient interviews to analyze their perceptions of medication intensity. CoTI identified key phrases, themes, and codebook that were more similar to those of the senior investigator than both junior investigators and baseline NLP models. We also implemented CoTI into a user-facing application to enable AI human interaction in qualitative analysis. However, collaboration between CoTI and junior investigators provided only marginal gains, suggesting they may overrely on CoTI and limit their independent critical thinking.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Throughout history, a prevailing paradigm in mental healthcare has been one in which distressed people may receive treatment with little understanding around how their experience is perceived by their care provider, and in turn, the decisions made by their provider around how treatment will progress. Paralleling this offline model of care, people who seek mental health support from AI chatbots are similarly provided little context for how their expressions of distress are processed by the model, and subsequently, the logic that may underlie model responses. People in severe distress who turn to AI chatbots for support thus find themselves caught between black boxes, with unique forms of agony that arise from these intersecting opacities, including misinterpreting model outputs or attributing greater capabilities to a model than are yet possible, which has led to documented real-world harms. Building on empirical research from clinical psychology and AI safety, alongside rights-oriented frameworks from medical ethics, we describe how the distinct psychological state induced by severe distress can influence chatbot interaction patterns, and argue that this state of mind (combined with differences in how a user might perceive a chatbot compared to a care provider) uniquely necessitates a higher standard of interpretability in comparison to general AI chatbot use. Drawing inspiration from newer interpretable treatment paradigms, we then describe specific technical and interface design approaches that could be used to adapt interpretability strategies from four specific mental health fields (psychotherapy, community-based crisis intervention, psychiatry, and care authorization) to AI models, including consideration of the role of interpretability in the treatment process and tensions that may arise with greater interpretability.

Abstract: This essay explores a techno-artistic experiment that reanimates a 1980s East German typewriter using a contemporary AI language model. Situated at the intersection of media archaeology and speculative design, the project questions dominant narratives of progress by embedding generative AI in an obsolete, tactile interface. Through public exhibitions and aesthetic intervention, we demonstrate how slowness, friction, and material render artificial intelligence not only visible but open to critical inquiry. Drawing on concepts such as zombie media, technostalgia, and speculative design, we argue that reappropriating outdated technologies enables new forms of critical engagement. Erika - the AI-enabled typewriter - functions as both interface and interruption, making space for reflection, irony, and cultural memory. In a moment of accelerated digital abstraction, projects like this foreground the value of deliberate slowness, experiential materiality, and historical depth. We conclude by advocating for a historicist design sensibility that challenges presentism and reorients human-machine interaction toward alternative, perceived futures.

Abstract: In the 15th century, printing revolutionized the dissemination of information. Innovations such as typewriters and computers have increased the speed and volume of information flows over time. More recent developments in large language models such as ChatGPT enable text to be generated in a matter of seconds. However, many people do not understand how this works and what the long-term implications are. That is why we have "hacked" an old typewriter so that users can interact with an LLM chatbot, which over 1,200 participants have now been able to experience. It helps to understand the possibilities and limitations of AI. It gives us researchers insights into participants' concepts of AI as well as their expectations and concerns. It raises questions about these technological developments and stimulates discussions about the social impact of the intensification and acceleration of information and communication flows.

Abstract: Dwell input shows promise for handheld mobile contexts, but its performance is impacted by target size and viewing distance. While fixed target sizes suffice in static setups, in mobile settings, frequent posture changes alter viewing distances, which in turn distort perceived size and hinder dwell performance. We address this through GAUI, a Gaze-based Adaptive User Interface that dynamically resizes targets to maximise performance at the given viewing distance. In a two-phased study (N=24), GAUI leveraged the strengths of its distance-responsive design, outperforming the large UI static baseline in task time, and being less error-prone than the small UI static baseline. It was rated the most preferred interface overall. Participants reflected on using GAUI in six different postures. We discuss how their experience is impacted by posture, and propose guidelines for designing context-aware adaptive UIs for dwell interfaces on handheld mobile devices that maximise performance.

Abstract: The potential of using gaze as an input modality in the mobile context is growing. While users often encumber themselves by carrying objects and using mobile devices while walking, the impact of encumbrance on gaze input performance remains unexplored. To investigate this, we conducted a user study (N=24) to evaluate the effect of encumbrance on the performance of 1) Gaze using Dwell time (with/without visual feedback), 2) GazeTouch (with/without visual feedback), and 3) One- or two-hand touch input. While Touch generally performed better, Gaze, especially with feedback, showed a consistent performance regardless of whether participants were encumbered or unencumbered. Participants' preferences for input modalities varied with encumbrance: they preferred Gaze when encumbered, and touch when unencumbered. Our findings enhance understanding of the effect of encumbrance on gaze input and contribute towards selecting appropriate input modalities in future mobile user interfaces to account for situational impairments.

Abstract: Silent speech interface (SSI) enables hands-free input without audible vocalization, but most SSI systems do not verify speaker identity. We present HEar-ID, which uses consumer active noise-canceling earbuds to capture low-frequency "whisper" audio and high-frequency ultrasonic reflections. Features from both streams pass through a shared encoder, producing embeddings that feed a contrastive branch for user authentication and an SSI head for silent spelling recognition. This design supports decoding of 50 words while reliably rejecting impostors, all on commodity earbuds with a single model. Experiments demonstrate that HEar-ID achieves strong spelling accuracy and robust authentication.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as epistemic partners in everyday reasoning, yet their errors remain predominantly analyzed through predictive metrics rather than through their interpretive effects on human judgment. This study examines how different forms of epistemic failure emerge, are masked, and are tolerated in human AI interaction, where failure is understood as a relational breakdown shaped by model-generated plausibility and human interpretive judgment. We conducted a three round, multi LLM evaluation using interdisciplinary tasks and progressively differentiated assessment frameworks to observe how evaluators interpret model responses across linguistic, epistemic, and credibility dimensions. Our findings show that LLM errors shift from predictive to hermeneutic forms, where linguistic fluency, structural coherence, and superficially plausible citations conceal deeper distortions of meaning. Evaluators frequently conflated criteria such as correctness, relevance, bias, groundedness, and consistency, indicating that human judgment collapses analytical distinctions into intuitive heuristics shaped by form and fluency. Across rounds, we observed a systematic verification burden and cognitive drift. As tasks became denser, evaluators increasingly relied on surface cues, allowing erroneous yet well formed answers to pass as credible. These results suggest that error is not solely a property of model behavior but a co-constructed outcome of generative plausibility and human interpretive shortcuts. Understanding AI epistemic failure therefore requires reframing evaluation as a relational interpretive process, where the boundary between system failure and human miscalibration becomes porous. The study provides implications for LLM assessment, digital literacy, and the design of trustworthy human AI communication.

Abstract: Working memory enables the brain to integrate transient information for rapid decision-making. Artificial networks typically replicate this via recurrent or parallel architectures, yet incur high energy costs and noise sensitivity. Here we report IPNet, a hardware-software co-designed neuromorphic architecture realizing human-like working memory via neuronal intrinsic plasticity. Exploiting Joule-heating dynamics of Magnetic Tunnel Junctions (MTJs), IPNet physically emulates biological memory volatility. The memory behavior of the proposed architecture shows similar trends in n-back, free recall and memory interference tasks to that of reported human subjects. Implemented exclusively with MTJ neurons, the architecture with human-like working memory achieves 99.65% accuracy on 11-class DVS gesture datasets and maintains 99.48% on a novel 22-class time-reversed benchmark, outperforming RNN, LSTM, and 2+1D CNN baselines sharing identical backbones. For autonomous driving (DDD-20), IPNet reduces steering prediction error by 14.4% compared to ResNet-LSTM. Architecturally, we identify a 'Memory-at-the-Frontier' effect where performance is maximized at the sensing interface, validating a bio-plausible near-sensor processing paradigm. Crucially, all results rely on raw parameters from fabricated devices without optimization. Hardware-in-the-loop validation confirms the system's physical realizability. Separately, energy analysis reveals a reduction in memory power of 2,874x compared to LSTMs and 90,920x versus parallel 3D-CNNs. This capacitor-free design enables a compact ~1.5um2 footprint (28 nm CMOS): a >20-fold reduction over standard LIF neurons. Ultimately, we demonstrate that instantiating human-like working memory via intrinsic neuronal plasticity endows neural networks with the dual biological advantages of superior dynamic vision processing and minimal metabolic cost.

Abstract: Widespread Pb (lead) contamination of urban soil significantly impacts food safety and public health and hinders city greening efforts. However, most existing technologies for measuring Pb are labor-intensive and costly. In this study, we propose SoilScanner, a radio frequency-based wireless system that can detect Pb in soils. This is based on our discovery that the propagation of different frequency band radio signals is affected differently by different salts such as NaCl and Pb(NO3)2 in the soil. In a controlled experiment, manually adding NaCl and Pb(NO3)2 in clean soil, we demonstrated that different salts reflected signals at different frequencies in distinct patterns. In addition, we confirmed the finding using uncontrolled field samples with a machine learning model. Our experiment results show that SoilScanner can classify soil samples into low-Pb and high-Pb categories (threshold at 200 ppm) with an accuracy of 72%, with no sample with > 500 ppm of Pb being misclassified. The results of this study show that it is feasible to build portable and affordable Pb detection and screening devices based on wireless technology.
