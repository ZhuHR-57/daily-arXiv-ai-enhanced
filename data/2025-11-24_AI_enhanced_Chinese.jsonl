We introduce PhysMorph-GS, which couples a differentiable material point method (MPM) with 3D Gaussian splatting through a deformation-aware upsampling bridge that maps sparse particle states (x, F) to dense Gaussians (mu, Sigma). Multi-modal rendering losses on silhouette and depth backpropagate along two paths, from covariances to deformation gradients via a stretch-based mapping and from Gaussian means to particle positions. Through the MPM adjoint, these gradients update deformation controls while mass is conserved at a compact set of anchor particles. A multi-pass interleaved optimization scheme repeatedly injects rendering gradients into successive physics steps, avoiding collapse to purely physics-driven solutions. On challenging morphing sequences, PhysMorph-GS improves boundary fidelity and temporal stability over a differentiable MPM baseline and better reconstructs thin structures such as ears and tails. Quantitatively, our depth-supervised variant reduces Chamfer distance by about 2.5 percent relative to the physics-only baseline. By providing a differentiable particle-to-Gaussian bridge, PhysMorph-GS closes a key gap in physics-aware rendering pipelines and enables inverse design directly from image-space supervision.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, the dynamics of multi-agent systems for this task remain unexplored. In this work, we present a logical framework for comparing multi-agent PyTorch optimization systems. Our evaluation shows that exploit-heavy strategies perform best when paired with error-fixing agents, and that performance correlates with the granularity of optimization steps.

Drawing on frameworks from social psychology and technology acceptance models, the research addresses gaps in user-centric factors influencing AI trust. Fifty-five undergraduate students participated in an experiment involving 30 decision-making scenarios (factual, emotional, moral), selecting from AI agents (e.g., ChatGPT), voice assistants, peers, adults, or priests as guides. Data were analyzed using K-Modes and K-Means clustering for patterns, and XGBoost models with SHAP interpretations to predict AI selection based on sociodemographic and prior trust variables.\n  Results showed adults (35.05\\%) and AI (28.29\\%) as the most selected agents overall. Clustering revealed context-specific preferences: AI dominated factual scenarios, while humans prevailed in social/moral ones. Lower prior trust in human agents (priests, peers, adults) consistently predicted higher AI selection, supporting deferred trust as a compensatory transfer. Participant profiles with higher AI trust were distinguished by human distrust, lower technology use, and higher socioeconomic status. Models demonstrated consistent performance (e.g., average precision up to 0.863).\n  Findings challenge traditional models like TAM/UTAUT, emphasizing relational and epistemic dimensions in AI trust. They highlight risks of over-reliance due to fluency effects and underscore the need for transparency to calibrate vigilance. Limitations include sample homogeneity and static scenarios; future work should incorporate diverse populations and multimodal data to refine deferred trust across contexts.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In the representative scenario of smart farming, planning efficient harvesting schedules for a fleet of electric robots presents a highly challenging frontier problem. The complexity arises not only from the need to find Pareto-optimal solutions for the conflicting objectives of makespan and transportation cost, but also from the necessity to simultaneously manage payload constraints and finite battery capacity. When robot loads are dynamically updated during planned multi-trip operations, a mandatory recharge triggered by energy constraints introduces an unscheduled load reset. This interaction creates a complex cascading effect that disrupts the entire schedule and renders traditional optimization methods ineffective. To address this challenge, this paper proposes the segment anchoring-based balancing algorithm (SABA). The core of SABA lies in the organic combination of two synergistic mechanisms: the sequential anchoring and balancing mechanism, which leverages charging decisions as `anchors' to systematically reconstruct disrupted routes, while the proportional splitting-based rebalancing mechanism is responsible for the fine-grained balancing and tuning of the final solutions' makespans. Extensive comparative experiments, conducted on a real-world case study and a suite of benchmark instances, demonstrate that SABA comprehensively outperforms 6 state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of both solution convergence and diversity. This research provides a novel theoretical perspective and an effective solution for the multi-robot task allocation problem under energy constraints.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

After completing the search, participants were asked to recall objects that may or may not have been present in the scene. The use of navigation aids impacted object recall, with impaired recall of objects in the environment when an aid was switched on.

Existing methods often assume pre-defined missing modalities or fixed missing rates, limiting their real-world applicability. To address this challenge, we propose Senti-iFusion, an integrity-centered hierarchical fusion framework capable of handling both inter- and intra-modality missingness simultaneously. It comprises three hierarchical components: Integrity Estimation, Integrity-weighted Completion, and Integrity-guided Fusion. First, the Integrity Estimation module predicts the completeness of each modality and mitigates the noise caused by incomplete data. Second, the Integrity-weighted Cross-modal Completion module employs a novel weighting mechanism to disentangle consistent semantic structures from modality-specific representations, enabling the precise recovery of sentiment-related features across language, acoustic, and visual modalities. To ensure consistency in reconstruction, a dual-depth validation with semantic- and feature-level losses ensures consistent reconstruction at both fine-grained (low-level) and semantic (high-level) scales. Finally, the Integrity-guided Adaptive Fusion mechanism dynamically selects the dominant modality for attention-based fusion, ensuring that the most reliable modality, based on completeness and quality, contributes more significantly to the final prediction. Senti-iFusion employs a progressive training approach to ensure stable convergence. Experimental results on popular MSA datasets demonstrate that Senti-iFusion outperforms existing methods, particularly in fine-grained sentiment analysis tasks.
