Abstract: Adaptive streaming of 360-degree video relies on viewport prediction to allocate bandwidth efficiently. Current approaches predominantly use visual saliency or historical gaze patterns, neglecting the role of spatial audio in guiding user attention. This paper presents a self-learning framework for detecting "surprising" auditory events -- moments that deviate from learned temporal expectations -- and demonstrates their utility for viewport prediction. The proposed architecture combines $SE(3)$-equivariant graph neural networks with recurrent temporal modeling, trained via a dual self-supervised objective. A key feature is the natural modeling of temporal attention decay: surprise is high at event onset but diminishes as the listener adapts. Experiments on the AVTrack360 dataset show that integrating audio surprise with visual cues reduces bitrate waste by up to 18% compared to visual-only methods.

Abstract: We present a novel, regression-based method for artistically styling images. Unlike recent neural style transfer or diffusion-based approaches, our method allows for explicit control over the stroke composition and level of detail in the rendered image through the use of an extensible set of stroke patches. The stroke patch sets are procedurally generated by small programs that control the shape, size, orientation, density, color, and noise level of the strokes in the individual patches. Once trained on a set of stroke patches, a U-Net based regression model can render any input image in a variety of distinct, evocative and customizable styles.

Abstract: Avatar embodiment experiences have the potential to enhance human capabilities by extending human senses, body, and mind. This study investigates social acceptance of robotic and virtual avatars as enablers of capability enhancement in six domains: identity exploration, well-being and behavioral transformation, expanded travel capabilities, expanded bodily and sensory abilities, cognitive augmentation, and immortality. We conducted a large-scale survey (n = 1001) in Dubai to explore acceptance of sixteen capability enhancement scenarios within these domains. The highest levels of agreement were observed for multilingual communication (77.5%) and learning capabilities (68.7%), followed by assisting individuals with reduced mobility (64.5%) and behavioral transformation (59.5%). Scenarios involving immortality through consciousness transfer received the least support (34.9%). These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of public attitudes toward avatar-based human enhancement and offer practical guidance for the responsible design, development, and integration of cybernetic avatars in the society, ensuring their societal acceptance and fostering a harmonious human-avatar coexistence.

Abstract: Automated interviewing tools are now widely adopted to manage recruitment at scale, often replacing early human screening with algorithmic assessments. While these systems are promoted as efficient and consistent, they also generate new forms of uncertainty for applicants. Efforts to soften these experiences through human-like design features have only partially addressed underlying concerns. To understand how candidates interpret and cope with such systems, we conducted a mixed empirical investigation that combined analysis of online discussions, responses from more than one hundred and fifty survey participants, and follow-up conversations with seventeen interviewees. The findings point to several recurring problems, including unclear evaluation criteria, limited organizational responsibility for automated outcomes, and a lack of practical support for preparation. Many participants described the technology as far less advanced than advertised, leading them to infer how decisions might be made in the absence of guidance. This speculation often intensified stress and emotional strain. Furthermore, the minimal sense of interpersonal engagement contributed to feelings of detachment and disposability. Based on these observations, we propose design directions aimed at improving clarity, accountability, and candidate support in AI-mediated hiring processes.

Abstract: Video see-through (VST) technology aims to seamlessly blend virtual and physical worlds by reconstructing reality through cameras. While manufacturers promise perceptual fidelity, it remains unclear how close these systems are to replicating natural human vision across varying environmental conditions. In this work, we quantify the perceptual gap between the human eye and different popular VST headsets (Apple Vision Pro, Meta Quest 3, Quest Pro) using psychophysical measures of visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, and color vision. We show that despite hardware advancements, all tested VST systems fail to match the dynamic range and adaptability of the naked eye. While high-end devices approach human performance in ideal lighting, they exhibit significant degradation in low-light conditions, particularly in contrast sensitivity and acuity. Our results map the physiological limitations of digital reality reconstruction, establishing a specific perceptual gap that defines the roadmap for achieving indistinguishable VST experiences.

Abstract: Extended reality (XR) is evolving into a general-purpose computing platform, yet its adoption for productivity is hindered by visual fatigue and simulator sickness. While these symptoms are often attributed to latency or motion conflicts, the precise impact of textual clarity on physiological comfort remains undefined. Here we show that sub-optimal effective resolution, the clarity that reaches the eye after the full display-optics-rendering pipeline, is a primary driver of simulator sickness during reading tasks in both virtual reality and video see-through environments. By systematically manipulating end-to-end effective resolution on a unified logMAR scale, we measured reading psychophysics and sickness symptoms in a controlled within-subjects study. We find that reading performance and user comfort degrade exponentially as resolution drops below 0 logMAR (normal visual acuity). Notably, our results reveal 0 logMAR as a key physiological tipping point: resolutions better than this threshold yield naked-eye-level performance with minimal sickness, whereas poorer resolutions trigger rapid, non-linear increases in nausea and oculomotor strain. These findings suggest that the cognitive and perceptual effort required to resolve blurry text directly compromises user comfort, establishing human-eye resolution as a critical baseline for the design of future ergonomic XR systems.

Abstract: Autonomous driving improves traffic efficiency but presents safety challenges in complex port environments. This study investigates how environmental factors, traffic factors, and pedestrian characteristics influence interaction safety between autonomous vehicles and pedestrians in ports. Using virtual reality (VR) simulations of typical port scenarios, 33 participants completed pedestrian crossing tasks under varying visibility, vehicle sizes, and time pressure conditions. Results indicate that low-visibility conditions, partial occlusions and larger vehicle sizes significantly increase perceived risk, prompting pedestrians to wait longer and accept larger gaps. Specifically, pedestrians tended to accept larger gaps and waited longer when interacting with large autonomous truck platoons, reflecting heightened caution due to their perceived threat. However, local obstructions also reduce post-encroachment time, compressing safety margins. Individual attributes such as age, gender, and driving experience further shape decision-making, while time pressure undermines compensatory behaviors and increases risk. Based on these findings, safety strategies are proposed, including installing wide-angle cameras at multiple viewpoints, enabling real-time vehicle-infrastructure communication, enhancing port lighting and signage, and strengthening pedestrian safety training. This study offers practical recommendations for improving the safety and deployment of vision-based autonomous systems in port settings.

Abstract: Appropriate communication is crucial for efficient and safe interactions between pedestrians and autonomous vehicles (AVs). External human-machine interfaces (eHMIs) on AVs, which can be categorized as allocentric or egocentric, are considered a promising solution. While the effectiveness of eHMIs has been extensively studied, in complex environments, such as unsignalized multi-lane streets, their potential to interfere with pedestrian crossing behavior remains underexplored. Hence, a virtual reality-based experiment was conducted to examine how different types of eHMIs displayed on AVs affect the crossing behavior of pedestrians in multi-lane streets environments, with a focus on the gaze patterns of pedestrians during crossing. The results revealed that the presence of eHMIs significantly influenced the cognitive load on pedestrians and increased the possibility of distraction, even misleading pedestrians in cases involving multiple AVs on multi-lane streets. Notably, allocentric eHMIs induced higher cognitive loads and greater distraction in pedestrians than egocentric eHMIs. This was primarily evidenced by longer gaze time and higher proportions of attention for the eHMI on the interacting vehicle, as well as a broader distribution of gaze toward vehicles in the non-interacting lane. However, misleading behavior was mainly triggered by eHMI signals from yielding vehicles in the non-interacting lane. Under such asymmetric signal configurations, egocentric eHMIs resulted in a higher misjudgment rate than allocentric eHMIs. These findings highlight the importance of enhancing eHMI designs to balance the clarity and consistency of the displayed information across different perspectives, especially in complex multi-lane traffic scenarios. This study provides valuable insights regarding the application and standardization of future eHMI systems for AVs.

Abstract: Although automated trucks have the potential to improve freight efficiency, reduce costs, and address driver shortages, organizing two or more trucks in a convoy has raised considerable concerns for pedestrian safety. This study conducted a controlled experiment to examine the influence of behavioral tendency, trust, and risk perception on pedestrian intention to cross in front of an automated truck platoon. A total of 603 subjects participated in the virtual reality video-based questionnaire survey. By fusing the merits of structural equation modeling and artificial neural networks, a two-stage, hybrid model was developed to examine complex relationships between latent variables and gap-acceptance behaviors. Our results indicated that subjects watched an average of five vehicle gaps before starting crossing and the average time gap accepted was about 5.35 seconds. Risk perception not only played the most dominant role in shaping pedestrian crossing decisions, but also served as the strong bone, mediating the effects of behavioral tendency and trust on gap-acceptance. Participants who frequently violated traffic rules were more likely to accept a smaller time gap, while those who showed positive behaviors to other road users tended to wait for a larger time gap. Participants who often committed errors, showed aggressive behaviors, and held greater trust in the safety of automated trucks generally reported a lower level of risk for road-crossing in front of automated truck platoons. Built on these findings, a range of tailored countermeasures were proposed to ensure safer and smother interactions between pedestrians and automated truck platoons.

Abstract: Maximum partial subgraph isomorphism compares two graphs (nodes joined by edges) to find a largest common subgraph. A common use case, for graphs with labeled nodes, seeks to find instances of a \textit{query} graph with $q$ nodes in a (typically larger) \textit{data} graph with $d$ nodes. The problem is NP-complete, and naïve solutions are exponential in $q + d$. The fastest current heuristic has complexity $O(d^2)$. This paper outlines ASSIST (Approximate Swarming Subgraph Isomorphism through Stigmergy), inspired by the ant colony optimization approach to the traveling salesperson. After peering (identifying matching individual nodes in query and data) in time $O(q\cdot log(d))$, the time required for ASSIST's iterative subgraph search, the combinatorially complex part of the problem, is linear in query size and constant in data size. ASSIST can be extended to support matching problems (such as temporally ordered edges, inexact matches, and missing nodes or edges in the data graph) that frustrate other heuristics.

Abstract: This work presents a microscopic model to describe pedestrian flows based on the social force theory. The aim of this study is twofold: (1) developing a realistic model that can be used as a tool for designing pedestrian-friendly infrastructure, and (2) verifying a social science theory using a model with sufficient data. The investigation of the pedestrian model shows that despite simple individual behavior patterns, complex spatial and temporal structures emerge through the interactions in pedestrian flows. Collective behavior emerges from individuals following two basic rules: (1) moving directly towards their goal at a certain speed, and (2) maintaining a distance to other pedestrians and obstacles. This self-organized collective behavior manifests itself as trails that are formed by pedestrians moving in one direction. Furthermore, strong dependencies of the properties of pedestrian flows on geometric forms of buildings are shown, and the influence of geometric changes on performance characteristics is investigated. An example demonstrates how efficiency can be increased by reducing walkable areas. This work also presents an evolutionary algorithm for optimizing building layouts based on the social force model. Additionally, a decision-making model is integrated to describe alternative goal selection, and adaptation and learning capabilities are included to improve pedestrian avoidance behavior and decision strategies based on accumulated experience. A method for determining load distributions in individual sections of a path system considering subjective selection criteria is also developed. Finally, a model that describes the self-organization of path systems with minimal detours is presented, similar to natural transport networks where total length and material costs are optimized.
