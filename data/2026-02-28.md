Abstract: This study explores integrating sign language into virtual reality (VR) by examining the comprehensibility and user experience of viewing American Sign Language (ASL) videos captured with body-mounted 360-degree cameras. Ten participants identified ASL signs from videos recorded at three body-mounted positions: head, shoulder, and chest. Results showed the shoulder-mounted camera achieved the highest accuracy (85%), though differences between positions were not statistically significant. Participants noted that peripheral distortion in 360-degree videos impacted clarity, highlighting areas for improvement. Despite challenges, the overall comprehension success rate of 83.3% demonstrates the potential of video-based ASL communication in VR. Feedback emphasized the need to refine camera angles, reduce distortion, and explore alternative mounting positions. Participants expressed a preference for signing over text-based communication in VR, highlighting the importance of developing this approach to enhance accessibility and collaboration for Deaf and Hard of Hearing (DHH) users in virtual environments.

Abstract: Training resources for parasports are limited, reducing opportunities for athletes and coaches to engage with sport-specific movements and tactical coordination. To address this gap, we developed BRIDGE, a system that integrates a reconstruction pipeline, which detects and tracks players from broadcast video to generate 3D play sequences, with an embodiment-aware visualization framework that decomposes head, trunk, and wheelchair base orientations to represent attention, intent, and mobility. We evaluated BRIDGE in two controlled studies with 20 participants (10 national wheelchair basketball team players and 10 amateur players). The results showed that BRIDGE significantly enhanced the perceived naturalness of player postures and made tactical intentions easier to understand. In addition, it supported functional classification by realistically conveying players' capabilities, which in turn improved participants' sense of self-efficacy. This work advances inclusive sports learning and accessible coaching practices, contributing to more equitable access to tactical resources in parasports.

Abstract: AI-powered scientific research tools are rapidly being integrated into research workflows, yet the field lacks a clear lens into how researchers use these systems in real-world settings. We present and analyze the Asta Interaction Dataset, a large-scale resource comprising over 200,000 user queries and interaction logs from two deployed tools (a literature discovery interface and a scientific question-answering interface) within an LLM-powered retrieval-augmented generation platform. Using this dataset, we characterize query patterns, engagement behaviors, and how usage evolves with experience. We find that users submit longer and more complex queries than in traditional search, and treat the system as a collaborative research partner, delegating tasks such as drafting content and identifying research gaps. Users treat generated responses as persistent artifacts, revisiting and navigating among outputs and cited evidence in non-linear ways. With experience, users issue more targeted queries and engage more deeply with supporting citations, although keyword-style queries persist even among experienced users. We release the anonymized dataset and analysis with a new query intent taxonomy to inform future designs of real-world AI research assistants and to support realistic evaluation.
