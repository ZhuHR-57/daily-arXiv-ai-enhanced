An application of the filter is presented in the context of human animation replay for real-time simulations, where switches in animation clips cause discontinuities that must be hidden by filtering the bone trajectory without introducing noticeable artifacts. The quality of the filtering will be compared with other common animation filtering techniques using an example case drawn fromthe LaFAN1 dataset, showing that the resulting animation is replayed with higher fidelity by evaluating the Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Normalized Power Spectrum Similarity (NPSS) for each setup. Performances will be evaluated using both a standard predetermined triggerpoint and blending distance and the automatic blending trigger and recovery system."}

This integration requires AI to move beyond acting as an assistant for informational or transactional tasks toward a genuine collaborative partner. Effective collaboration, whether between humans or between humans and AI, depends on establishing and maintaining common ground: shared beliefs, assumptions, goals, and situational awareness that enable coordinated action and efficient repair of misunderstandings. While common ground is a central concept in human collaboration, it has received limited attention in studies of human-AI collaboration. In this paper, we introduce a new benchmark grounded in theories and empirical studies of human-human collaboration. The benchmark is based on a collaborative puzzle task that requires iterative interaction, joint action, referential coordination, and repair under varying conditions of situation awareness. We validate the benchmark through a confirmatory user study in which human participants collaborate with an AI to solve the task. The results show that the benchmark reproduces established theoretical and empirical findings from human-human collaboration, while also revealing clear divergences in human-AI interaction."}

Unlike a call or conference room abstraction of existing video conferencing services, it uses a named stream abstraction, which is useful in many scenarios beyond just a call or conference. It keeps most of the application logic in the endpoint using the extensive application interface of this component, and keeps any vendor specific access control or signaling negotiation in a service-specific connector implementation. This allows an app developer to write once, and be able to run the web app on different servers or services. We also demonstrate its flexibility by implementing the connector for ten different existing systems and services. Decoupling the app from the hosted vendor service promotes innovation in the endpoint beyond what a single vendor locked client app can offer."}

To examine this process, we develop an agent-based model (ABM) to identify the minimal conditions under which hierarchy arises in dynamic multi-agent systems, focusing on the roles of initial heterogeneity and mutation amplitude across generations. Hierarchical organisation is quantified using the Trophic Incoherence (TI) metric, which captures directional asymmetries in interaction networks. Our results show that even small individual differences can be amplified through repeated local interactions involving reproduction, competition, and cooperation, but that hierarchical order is markedly more sensitive to mutation amplitude than to initial heterogeneity. Across repeated trials, stable hierarchies reliably emerge only when mutation amplitude is sufficiently high, while initial heterogeneity primarily affects early formation rather than long-term persistence. Overall, these findings demonstrate how simple interaction rules can give rise to both the emergence and persistence of hierarchical organisation, providing a quantitative account of how structured inequality can develop from initially homogeneous populations."}

This work examines a paradigm of creative decomposition and linking, which allows creators to clearly communicate creative intent by prompting GenAI to tailor specific story elements, such as storylines, personas, locations, and scenes, while maintaining coherence among them. We implement and evaluate StoryComposerAI, a system that exemplifies this paradigm for enhancing users' sense of control and content consistency in human-AI co-creation of digital stories."}

Even though metrics of responsibility tailored to spatial interactions have been proposed, they are mostly focused on the responsibility of individual agents. Metrics of causal responsibility focusing on individuals fail in cases of causal overdeterminism -- when many actors simultaneously cause an outcome. To fill the gaps in causal responsibility left by individual-focused metrics, we formulate a metric for the causal responsibility of groups. To identify assertive agents that are causally responsible for the trajectory of an affected agent, we further formalise the types of assertive influences and propose a tiering algorithm for systematically identifying assertive agents. Finally, we use scenario-based simulations to illustrate the benefits of considering groups and how the emergence of group effects vary with interaction dynamics and the proximity of agents."}

To address this, we present WatchHand, the first continuous 3D hand pose tracking system implemented on off-the-shelf smartwatches using only their built-in speaker and microphone. WatchHand emits inaudible frequency-modulated continuous waves and captures their reflections from the hand. These acoustic signals are processed by a deep-learning model that estimates 3D hand poses for 20 finger joints. We evaluate WatchHand across diverse real-world conditions -- multiple smartwatch models, wearing-hands, body postures, noise conditions, pose-variation protocols -- and achieve a mean per-joint position error of 7.87 mm in cross-session tests with device remounting. Although performance drops for unseen users or gestures, the model adapts effectively with lightweight fine-tuning on small amounts of data. Overall, WatchHand lowers the barrier to smartwatch-based hand tracking by eliminating additional hardware while enabling robust, always-available interactions on millions of existing devices."}

However, there are known concerns, such as fear of judgment and backlash, that may discourage women from posting online. In this study, we examine a recurring practice on Xiaohongshu, a popular Chinese social media platform, in which women share their gendered experiences alongside screenshots of conversations with LLMs. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 20 women to investigate whether and how interactions with LLMs might support women in articulating and sharing gendered experiences. Our findings reveal that, beyond those external concerns, women also hold self-imposed standards regarding what feels appropriate and worthwhile to share publicly. We further show how interactions with LLMs help women meet these standards and navigate such concerns. We conclude by discussing how LLMs might be carefully and critically leveraged to support women's everyday expression online."}

A guide can use a tablet application to annotate a photogrammetry-based map of a mountainside, for example, one collected using a commercial camera drone, with hazard points, slow-down zones, and safe zones. These annotations are communicated to the skiers via visual overlays in augmented reality heads-up displays.

In a user study that features a teleport-and-orient task, we evaluate six teleportation techniques, covering two mode-switching methods (Button and Flip) and three orientation approaches (StylusRoll, StylusPoint, and GazePoint).

We articulate three prominent values in these texts - universality, objectivity, and efficiency - and examine how these values permeate visualization tools, curricula, and research practices. We situate these values within a broader set of critiques that call for more diverse priorities and viewpoints. By articulating these tensions, we call for our community to embrace a more pluralistic range of values to shape our future visualization tools and guidelines."}

It provides feedback through visual overlays, rhythm and timing cues, and an AI-powered coaching agent using 3D motion reconstruction. We generate verbal feedback by analyzing spatio-temporal joint data and mapping features to natural-language coaching cues via a Large Language Model (LLM). A key novelty is this feedback generation: motion features become concise coaching insights.

Most existing systems are evaluated in controlled settings, focus primarily on in-person interactions, or rely on restrictive assumptions (e.g., requiring multiple speakers within fixed temporal windows), limiting generalizability to real-world use. We present an on-watch interaction detection system designed to capture diverse interactions in naturalistic settings. A core component is a foreground speech detector trained on a public dataset. Evaluated on over 100,000 labeled foreground speech and background sound instances, the detector achieves a balanced accuracy of 85.51%, outperforming prior work by 5.11%.\n  We evaluated the system in a real-world deployment (N=38), with over 900 hours of total smartwatch wear time. The system detected 1,691 interactions, 77.28% were confirmed via participant self-report, with durations ranging from under one minute to over one hour. Among correct detections, 81.45% were in-person, 15.7% virtual, and 1.85% hybrid. Leveraging participant-labeled data, we further developed a multimodal model achieving a balanced accuracy of 90.36% and a sensitivity of 91.17% on 33,698 labeled 15-second windows.

However, not all surprises are equally informative-some yield genuine insight while others remain aesthetic shock. Drawing on epiplexity-structured, learnable information extractable by bounded observers-we propose decomposing the knowledge generated by speculative artifacts into structured epistemic information (transferable implications about futures) and entropic noise (narrative, aesthetics, and surface-level surprise). We conclude by introducing a practical audit framework with a self-assessment questionnaire that enables designers to evaluate whether their speculations yield rich, high-epiplexity insights or remain at a superficial level.

Based on how creative responsibility was allocated between humans and the AI, we predefined four interaction modes: Human-Only, Human-Lead, AI-Lead, and Co-Evolution, and analysed how these modes manifested during sketch-based design ideation. Our results show that designers rarely rely on a single mode; instead, human-led and AI-led roles are frequently interwoven and shift across ideation instances. These findings provide an empirical basis for future work to investigate why designers shift roles with AI and how interactive systems can better support such dynamic collaboration."}
