Abstract: Accurate real-time wind vector estimation is essential for enhancing the safety, navigation accuracy, and energy efficiency of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Traditional approaches rely on external sensors or simplify vehicle dynamics, which limits their applicability during agile flight or in resource-constrained platforms. This paper proposes a real-time wind estimation method based solely on onboard sensors. The approach first estimates external aerodynamic forces using a disturbance observer (DOB), and then maps these forces to wind vectors using a thin-plate spline (TPS) model. A custom-designed wind barrel mounted on the UAV enhances aerodynamic sensitivity, further improving estimation accuracy. The system is validated through comprehensive experiments in wind tunnels, indoor and outdoor flights. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves consistently high-accuracy wind estimation across controlled and real-world conditions, with speed RMSEs as low as \SI{0.06}{m/s} in wind tunnel tests, \SI{0.22}{m/s} during outdoor hover, and below \SI{0.38}{m/s} in indoor and outdoor dynamic flights, and direction RMSEs under \ang{7.3} across all scenarios, outperforming existing baselines. Moreover, the method provides vertical wind estimates -- unavailable in baselines -- with RMSEs below \SI{0.17}{m/s} even during fast indoor translations.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Data valuation and monetisation are emerging as central challenges in data-driven economies, yet no unified framework exists to measure or manage data value across organisational contexts. This paper presents a systematic literature review of metrics and key performance indicators (KPIs) relevant to data valuation and monetisation, focusing on the Internal Processes Perspective of the Balanced Scorecard (BSC). As part of a broader effort to explore all four BSC perspectives, we identify, categorise, and interrelate hundreds of metrics within a comprehensive taxonomy structured around three core clusters: Data Quality, Governance & Compliance, and Operational Efficiency. The taxonomy consolidates overlapping definitions, clarifies conceptual dependencies, and links technical, organisational, and regulatory indicators that underpin data value creation. By integrating these dimensions, it provides a foundation for the development of standardised and evidence-based valuation frameworks. Beyond its theoretical contribution, the taxonomy supports ongoing practical applications in decision-support systems and data valuation models, advancing the broader goal of establishing a coherent, dynamic approach to assessing and monetising data across industries.

Abstract: Representing and rendering dynamic scenes with complex motions remains challenging in computer vision and graphics. Recent dynamic view synthesis methods achieve high-quality rendering but often produce physically implausible motions. We introduce NeHaD, a neural deformation field for dynamic Gaussian Splatting governed by Hamiltonian mechanics. Our key observation is that existing methods using MLPs to predict deformation fields introduce inevitable biases, resulting in unnatural dynamics. By incorporating physics priors, we achieve robust and realistic dynamic scene rendering. Hamiltonian mechanics provides an ideal framework for modeling Gaussian deformation fields due to their shared phase-space structure, where primitives evolve along energy-conserving trajectories. We employ Hamiltonian neural networks to implicitly learn underlying physical laws governing deformation. Meanwhile, we introduce Boltzmann equilibrium decomposition, an energy-aware mechanism that adaptively separates static and dynamic Gaussians based on their spatial-temporal energy states for flexible rendering. To handle real-world dissipation, we employ second-order symplectic integration and local rigidity regularization as physics-informed constraints for robust dynamics modeling. Additionally, we extend NeHaD to adaptive streaming through scale-aware mipmapping and progressive optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NeHaD achieves physically plausible results with a rendering quality-efficiency trade-off. To our knowledge, this is the first exploration leveraging Hamiltonian mechanics for neural Gaussian deformation, enabling physically realistic dynamic scene rendering with streaming capabilities.

Abstract: We propose DeMapGS, a structured Gaussian Splatting framework that jointly optimizes deformable surfaces and surface-attached 2D Gaussian splats. By anchoring splats to a deformable template mesh, our method overcomes topological inconsistencies and enhances editing flexibility, addressing limitations of prior Gaussian Splatting methods that treat points independently. The unified representation in our method supports extraction of high-fidelity diffuse, normal, and displacement maps, enabling the reconstructed mesh to inherit the photorealistic rendering quality of Gaussian Splatting. To support robust optimization, we introduce a gradient diffusion strategy that propagates supervision across the surface, along with an alternating 2D/3D rendering scheme to handle concave regions. Experiments demonstrate that DeMapGS achieves state-of-the-art mesh reconstruction quality and enables downstream applications for Gaussian splats such as editing and cross-object manipulation through a shared parametric surface.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and generative search systems are increasingly used for information seeking by diverse populations with varying preferences for knowledge sourcing and presentation. While users can customize LLM behavior through custom instructions and behavioral prompts, no mechanism exists to evaluate whether these instructions are being followed effectively. We present Offscript, an automated auditing tool that efficiently identifies potential instruction following failures in LLMs. In a pilot study analyzing custom instructions sourced from Reddit, Offscript detected potential deviations from instructed behavior in 86.4% of conversations, 22.2% of which were confirmed as material violations through human review. Our findings suggest that automated auditing serves as a viable approach for evaluating compliance to behavioral instructions related to information seeking.

Abstract: Sophisticated 3D visualization applications usually provide coordinated 2D and 3D views. Normally 3D input device is used for 3D tasks since they perform better than traditional 2D input devices. However, they do not perform better for 2D tasks. This paper presents a bimanual hybrid user interface that supports four interaction modes: a dual 6-degree-of-freedom (DOF) input device mode, a dual planar constrained 3DOF input device mode, a dual 2-finger multi-touch mode, and 3D hand and finger gestures. The application is a multi-dimensional visualization with coordinated 3D and 2D views on a desktop VR system. The input devices are buttonballs with seamless switching between 3D and 2D device modes, as well as between free-hand finger input and device usage. The 3D and 2D device mode switch automatically switches a buttonball's visual representation between a 3D cursor and a 2D cursor while changing the available user interaction techniques between 3D and 2D interaction techniques to interact with the coordinated views. The paper also provides two formal user studies to evaluate HyFinBall for various dimensional tasks, including 3D, 2D, and cross-dimensional tasks. Our experimental results show the benefits of the HyFinBall interface for cross-dimensional tasks that require 3D and 2D interactions.

Abstract: Human evaluation remains the gold standard for evaluating outputs of Large Language Models (LLMs). The current evaluation paradigm reviews numerous individual responses, leading to significant scalability challenges. LLM outputs can be more efficiently represented as a tree structure, reflecting their autoregressive generation process and stochastic token selection. However, conventional tree visualization cannot scale to the exponentially large trees generated by modern sampling methods of LLMs. To address this problem, we present InFerActive, an interactive inference system for scalable human evaluation. InFerActive enables on-demand exploration through probability-based filtering and evaluation features, while bridging the semantic gap between computational tokens and human-readable text through adaptive visualization techniques. Through a technical evaluation and user study (N=12), we demonstrate that InFerActive significantly improves evaluation efficiency and enables more comprehensive assessment of model behavior. We further conduct expert case studies that demonstrate InFerActive's practical applicability and potential for transforming LLM evaluation workflows.

Abstract: In smart-home voice assistant scenario, deciding whether to accept or reject a user query is the first step before any downstream processing. To address the limited query-rejection capability of current voice assistants, this paper presents the first Chinese-oriented open-source benchmark and evaluation suite for smart homes, together with a personalized query-rejection method based on large language models. On the data side, we construct the first multimodal query-rejection dataset tailored for domestic scenarios, containing 11,913 manually labeled text-speech pairs that systematically cover twelve typical dialogue types (e.g., chit-chat, non-human sounds, valid commands, ambiguous references, device-irrelevant requests). Fine-grained labels, conversational context and multi-turn information are provided to support both zero-shot and fine-tuning evaluations across language and multimodal large models. On the method side, we propose a three-tier collaborative architecture: first, a Qwen-2.5-3B adapter fine-tuned to model family-agnostic semantic boundaries; second, a dynamic household-level historical dialogue module to capture personalized habits; third, a household-specific RAG knowledge base that explicitly memorizes and revises past false-rejection cases. Experiments show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms zero-shot and fine-tuned general LLMs on the constructed dataset, with pronounced gains in rejection accuracy for family-specific expressions and complex multi-turn scenarios. This work provides a reproducible data foundation, evaluation standard and extensible technical framework for reliability research in smart-home voice interaction.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Social presence is central to the enjoyment of watching content together, yet modern media consumption is increasingly solitary. We investigate whether multi-agent conversational AI systems can recreate the dynamics of shared viewing experiences across diverse content types. We present CompanionCast, a general framework for orchestrating multiple role-specialized AI agents that respond to video content using multimodal inputs, speech synthesis, and spatial audio. Distinctly, CompanionCast integrates an LLM-as-a-Judge module that iteratively scores and refines conversations across five dimensions (relevance, authenticity, engagement, diversity, personality consistency). We validate this framework through sports viewing, a domain with rich dynamics and strong social traditions, where a pilot study with soccer fans suggests that multi-agent interaction improves perceived social presence compared to solo viewing. We contribute: (1) a generalizable framework for orchestrating multi-agent conversations around multimodal video content, (2) a novel evaluator-agent pipeline for conversation quality control, and (3) exploratory evidence of increased social presence in AI-mediated co-viewing. We discuss challenges and future directions for applying this approach to diverse viewing contexts including entertainment, education, and collaborative watching experiences.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Reinsurance decision-making exhibits the core structural properties that motivate multi-agent models: distributed and asymmetric information, partial observability, heterogeneous epistemic responsibilities, simulator-driven environment dynamics, and binding prudential and regulatory constraints. Deterministic workflow automation cannot meet these requirements, as it lacks the epistemic flexibility, cooperative coordination mechanisms, and norm-sensitive behaviour required for institutional risk-transfer.
  We propose the Reinsurance Constrained Multi-Agent Simulation Process (R-CMASP), a formal model that extends stochastic games and Dec-POMDPs by adding three missing elements: (i) simulator-coupled transition dynamics grounded in catastrophe, capital, and portfolio engines; (ii) role-specialized agents with structured observability, belief updates, and typed communication; and (iii) a normative feasibility layer encoding solvency, regulatory, and organizational rules as admissibility constraints on joint actions.
  Using LLM-based agents with tool access and typed message protocols, we show in a domain-calibrated synthetic environment that governed multi-agent coordination yields more stable, coherent, and norm-adherent behaviour than deterministic automation or monolithic LLM baselines--reducing pricing variance, improving capital efficiency, and increasing clause-interpretation accuracy. Embedding prudential norms as admissibility constraints and structuring communication into typed acts measurably enhances equilibrium stability.
  Overall, the results suggest that regulated, simulator-driven decision environments are most naturally modelled as norm-governed, simulator-coupled multi-agent systems.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF) is the problem of finding collision-free paths for a team of agents on a map. Although MAPF is NP-hard, the hardness of solving individual instances varies significantly, revealing a gap between theoretical complexity and actual hardness. This paper outlines three key research challenges in MAPF empirical hardness to understand such phenomena. The first challenge, known as algorithm selection, is determining the best-performing algorithms for a given instance. The second challenge is understanding the key instance features that affect MAPF empirical hardness, such as structural properties like phase transition and backbone/backdoor. The third challenge is how to leverage our knowledge of MAPF empirical hardness to effectively generate hard MAPF instances or diverse benchmark datasets. This work establishes a foundation for future empirical hardness research and encourages deeper investigation into these promising and underexplored areas.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We demonstrate how collective memory emerges in decentralized multi-agent systems through the interplay between individual agent memory and environmental trace communication. Our agents maintain internal memory states while depositing persistent environmental traces, creating a spatially distributed collective memory without centralized control. Comprehensive validation across five environmental conditions (20x20 to 50x50 grids, 5-20 agents, 50 runs per configuration) reveals a critical asymmetry: individual memory alone provides 68.7% performance improvement over no-memory baselines (1563.87 vs 927.23, p < 0.001), while environmental traces without memory fail completely. This demonstrates that memory functions independently but traces require cognitive infrastructure for interpretation. Systematic density-sweep experiments (rho in [0.049, 0.300], up to 625 agents) validate our theoretical phase transition prediction. On realistic large grids (30x30, 50x50), stigmergic coordination dominates above rho ~ 0.20, with traces outperforming memory by 36-41% on composite metrics despite lower food efficiency. The experimental crossover confirms the predicted critical density rho_c = 0.230 within 13% error.

Abstract: We present Thinking While Driving, a concurrent routing framework that integrates LLMs into a graph-based traffic environment. Unlike approaches that require agents to stop and deliberate, our system enables LLM-based route planning while agents are moving, significantly reducing intersection wait times. Under high traffic, agents average just 0.75 seconds of decision latency. To coordinate many agents in real-time, we implement a non-blocking asynchronous architecture using Unity coroutines and a dedicated request manager. The environment is a weighted undirected graph with live congestion metrics, updated continuously by the agents to enable shared perception. Our results show LLM-driven agents can dynamically adapt to traffic, reroute around congestion, and exhibit behaviors beyond static pathfinding, all while maintaining real-time performance. This work provides a reproducible framework for future research in adaptive routing and multi-agent cooperation.
