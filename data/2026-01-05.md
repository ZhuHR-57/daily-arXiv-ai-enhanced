Abstract: Digital Audio Workstations (DAWs) are central to modern music production but often encumber the musician's workflow, tethering them to a desk and hindering natural interaction with their instrument. Furthermore, effective remote collaboration remains a significant challenge, with existing solutions hampered by network latency and asynchronous file sharing. This paper investigates the potential of Mixed Reality (MR) to overcome these barriers, creating an intuitive environment for real-time, remote musical collaboration. We employ qualitative and speculative design techniques to better understand: 1) how players currently use DAWs, and 2) to imagine a speculative future of collaborative MR-DAWs. To facilitate this discussion, we developed and evaluated the usability of a design probe, MR-DAW. An MR system enabling multiple, geographically dispersed users to control a single, shared DAW instance while moving freely in their local spaces. Our networked system enables each remote musician to use a physical foot pedal for collaborative looping, merging a familiar, hands-free interaction with a shared virtual session. Based on interviews and system evaluations with 20 musicians, we analyze current practices, report on the user experience with our MR system, and speculate on the future of musical collaboration in MR. Our results highlight the affordances of MR for unencumbered musical interaction and provide a speculative outlook on the future of remote collaborative DAWs in the Musical Metaverse.

Abstract: Hospitals are among the most cognitively demanding indoor environments, especially for patients and visitors unfamiliar with their layout. This study investigates the effectiveness of an augmented reality (AR)-based handheld navigation system compared to traditional paper maps in a large hospital setting. Through a mixed-methods experiment with 32 participants, we measured navigation performance, cognitive workload (NASA-TLX), situational anxiety (STAI-State), spatial behavior, and user satisfaction. Results show that AR users completed navigation tasks significantly faster, made fewer errors, and reported lower anxiety and workload. However, paper map users demonstrated stronger spatial memory in sketch-based recall tasks, highlighting a trade-off between real-time efficiency and long-term spatial learning. We discuss implications for inclusive AR design, spatial cognition, and healthcare accessibility, offering actionable design strategies for adaptive indoor navigation tools.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: During musical collaboration, visual cues are essential for communication between musicians. Extended Reality (XR) applications, often used with head-mounted displays like Augmented Reality (AR) glasses, can limit the field of view (FOV) of players. We conducted a study to investigate the effects of limited FOV on co-presence, gesture recognition, overall enjoyment, and reaction time.
  Initially, we observed experienced musicians collaborating informally with and without visual occlusion, noting that collaboration suffered with limited FOV. We then conducted a within-subjects study with 19 participants, comparing an unrestricted FOV holographic setup called HoloJam to Nreal AR glasses with a 52$^{\circ}$ limited FOV. In the AR setup, we tested two conditions: standard AR with a 52$^{\circ}$ FOV and a modified AR notification system called Mini Musicians.
  Results showed that HoloJam provided higher co-presence, quicker gesture recognition, and greater enjoyment. The Mini Musicians application reduced reaction time and maintained enjoyment compared to the standard AR setup. We conclude that limited FOV impacts musical collaboration, but notifications can improve reaction time and should be considered in future XR music collaborations.

Abstract: AI-driven speech-to-text (STT) documentation systems are increasingly adopted in clinical settings to reduce documentation burden and improve workflow efficiency. However, their rapid deployment has outpaced understanding of the associated socio-technical risks, including transparency, reliability, patient autonomy, workflow alignment, and organizational governance. A clearer analysis of these risks is needed to support safe and equitable integration into healthcare practice. This study synthesizes interdisciplinary evidence from technical performance research, regulatory and ethical standards, clinical workflow analyses, and organizational policy guidance. The synthesis was used to develop a multi-layered socio-technical conceptual framework for evaluating and governing STT systems. Findings show that STT systems operate within tightly coupled socio-technical environments in which model performance, clinician oversight, patient rights, workflow design, and institutional governance are interdependent. The study offers a structured socio-technical governance framework and an implementation roadmap that outlines readiness assessment, vendor evaluation, pilot deployment, clinician training, ongoing monitoring, and iterative improvement. The framework emphasizes safeguards that protect patient autonomy, documentation integrity, and institutional trust while enabling the efficient and beneficial use of STT technologies. This work provides actionable guidance for healthcare organizations seeking to adopt STT systems responsibly and equitably.

Abstract: Cognitive reappraisal is a well-studied emotion regulation strategy that helps individuals reinterpret stressful situations to reduce their impact. Many digital mental health tools struggle to support this process because rigid scripts fail to accommodate how users naturally describe stressors. This study examined the feasibility of an LLM-based single-session intervention (SSI) for workplace stress reappraisal. We assessed short-term changes in stress-related outcomes and examined design tensions during use. We conducted a feasibility study with 100 employees at a large technology company who completed a structured cognitive reappraisal session delivered by a GPT-4o-based chatbot. Pre-post measures included perceived stress intensity, stress mindset, perceived demand, and perceived resources. These outcomes were analyzed using paired Wilcoxon signed-rank tests with correction for multiple comparisons. We also examined sentiment and stress trajectories across conversation quartiles using two RoBERTa-based classifiers and an LLM-based stress rater. Open-ended responses were analyzed using thematic analysis. Results showed significant reductions in perceived stress intensity and significant improvements in stress mindset. Changes in perceived resources and perceived demand trended in expected directions but were not statistically significant. Automated analyses indicated consistent declines in negative sentiment and stress over the course of the interaction. Qualitative findings suggested that participants valued the structured prompts for organizing thoughts, gaining perspective, and feeling acknowledged. Participants also reported tensions around scriptedness, preferred interaction length, and reactions to AI-driven empathy. These findings highlight both the promise and the design constraints of integrating LLMs into DMH interventions for workplace settings.

Abstract: The fast integration of artificial intelligence into mobile applications has completely changed the digital landscape; however, the impact of this change on user perception of AI features remains poorly understood. This large-scale analysis examined 1,484,633 mobile application reviews across 422 applications (200 AI-featuring, 222 control) from iOS App Store and Google Play Store. By employing sentiment classification, topic modeling, and concern-benefit categorization, we identified a major disconnect: only 11.9% of reviews mentioned AI, even though 47.4% of applications featured AI capabilities. AI-featuring applications received significantly lower ratings than traditional applications (d = 0.40); however, hierarchical regression revealed a hidden pattern - the negative relationship reversed after controlling for AI mentions and review characteristics (b = 0.405, p < .001). Privacy dominated user concerns (34.8% of concern-expressing reviews), while efficiency represented the primary benefit (42.3%). Effects varied greatly by category, from positive for Assistant applications (d = 0.55) to negative for Entertainment (d = -0.23). These findings suggest that AI features often operate below user awareness thresholds, and it is the explicit recognition of AI, rather than its mere presence, that drives negative evaluations. This challenges basic assumptions about technology acceptance in AI systems.

Abstract: Ensuring digital accessibility is essential for inclusive access to online services. However, many government and non-government websites that provide critical services - such as education, healthcare, and public administration - continue to exhibit significant accessibility and usability barriers. This study evaluates the accessibility of Bangladeshi government and non-government websites under WCAG~2.2 by combining automated accessibility assessments with user-reported feedback. A total of 212 websites were analyzed using multiple automated tools, complemented by a survey of 103 users to capture real-world usability, accessibility, and security experiences. The results reveal substantial disparities between government and non-government websites, highlighting persistent issues related to navigation complexity, interaction cost, visual readability, accessibility feature adoption, and authentication mechanisms. While non-government websites generally demonstrate better usability and functional performance, accessibility support remains inconsistent across both categories. The findings underscore the need for regular accessibility audits, user-centered design practices, and policy-driven interventions to improve digital inclusivity and ensure equitable access to online services for diverse user populations.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Continuous electroencephalography (EEG) is routinely used in neurocritical care to monitor seizures and other harmful brain activity, including rhythmic and periodic patterns that are clinically significant. Although deep learning methods have achieved high accuracy in seizure detection, most existing approaches remain seizure-centric, rely on discrete-label supervision, and are primarily evaluated using accuracy-based metrics. A central limitation of current EEG modeling practice is the weak correspondence between learned representations and how EEG findings are interpreted and summarized in clinical workflows. Harmful EEG activity exhibits overlapping patterns, graded expert agreement, and temporal persistence, which are not well captured by classification objectives alone. This work proposes a multimodal EEG representation learning framework that integrates signal-domain modeling with structured clinical language supervision. First, raw EEG is transformed into a longitudinal bipolar montage and time-frequency representations. Second, dual transformer-based encoders model complementary temporal and frequency-centric dependencies and are fused using an adaptive gating mechanism. Third, EEG embeddings are aligned with structured expert consensus descriptions through a contrastive objective. Finally, an EEG-conditioned text reconstruction loss is introduced as a representation-level constraint alongside standard classification loss. Experimental evaluation using a controlled train-validation-test split achieves a six-class test accuracy of 0.9797. Ablation analyses show that removing contrastive alignment reduces cross-modal retrieval performance from Recall@10 of 0.3390 to 0.0045, despite minimal change in classification accuracy. These findings demonstrate that discriminative accuracy does not reliably reflect representation quality for clinically meaningful EEG modeling.

Abstract: The development of effective autograders is key for scaling assessment and feedback. While NLP based autograding systems for open-ended response questions have been found to be beneficial for providing immediate feedback, autograders are not always liked, understood, or trusted by students. Our research tested the effect of transparency on students' attitudes towards autograders. Transparent autograders increased students' perceptions of autograder accuracy and willingness to discuss autograders in survey comments, but did not improve other related attitudes -- such as willingness to be graded by them on a test -- relative to the control without transparency. However, this lack of impact may be due to higher measured student trust towards autograders in this study than in prior work in the field. We briefly discuss possible reasons for this trend.

Abstract: Agent communication remains a foundational problem in multi-agent systems: protocols such as FIPA-ACL guarantee semantic richness but are intractable for constrained environments, while lightweight IoT protocols achieve efficiency at the expense of expressiveness. This paper presents $μ$ACP, a formal calculus for expressive agent communication under explicit resource bounds. We formalize the Resource-Constrained Agent Communication (RCAC) model, prove that a minimal four-verb basis \textit{\{PING, TELL, ASK, OBSERVE\}} is suffices to encode finite-state FIPA protocols, and establish tight information-theoretic bounds on message complexity. We further show that $μ$ACP can implement standard consensus under partial synchrony and crash faults, yielding a constructive coordination framework for edge-native agents. Formal verification in TLA$^{+}$ (model checking) and Coq (mechanized invariants) establishes safety and boundedness, and supports liveness under modeled assumptions. Large-scale system simulations confirm ACP achieves a median end-to-end message latency of 34 ms (95th percentile 104 ms) at scale, outperforming prior agent and IoT protocols under severe resource constraints. The main contribution is a unified calculus that reconciles semantic expressiveness with provable efficiency, providing a rigorous foundation for the next generation of resource-constrained multi-agent systems.

Abstract: The next-generation wireless technologies, including beyond 5G and 6G networks, are paving the way for transformative applications such as vehicle platooning, smart cities, and remote surgery. These innovations are driven by a vast array of interconnected wireless entities, including IoT devices, access points, UAVs, and CAVs, which increase network complexity and demand more advanced decision-making algorithms. Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), especially reinforcement learning (RL), are key enablers for such networks, providing solutions to high-dimensional and complex challenges. However, as networks expand to multi-agent environments, traditional online RL approaches face cost, safety, and scalability limitations. Offline multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) offers a promising solution by utilizing pre-collected data, reducing the need for real-time interaction. This article introduces a novel offline MARL algorithm based on conservative Q-learning (CQL), ensuring safe and efficient training. We extend this with meta-learning to address dynamic environments and validate the approach through use cases in radio resource management and UAV networks. Our work highlights offline MARL's advantages, limitations, and future directions in wireless applications.

Abstract: As multi-agent AI systems become increasingly autonomous, evidence shows they can develop collusive strategies similar to those long observed in human markets and institutions. While human domains have accumulated centuries of anti-collusion mechanisms, it remains unclear how these can be adapted to AI settings. This paper addresses that gap by (i) developing a taxonomy of human anti-collusion mechanisms, including sanctions, leniency & whistleblowing, monitoring & auditing, market design, and governance and (ii) mapping them to potential interventions for multi-agent AI systems. For each mechanism, we propose implementation approaches. We also highlight open challenges, such as the attribution problem (difficulty attributing emergent coordination to specific agents) identity fluidity (agents being easily forked or modified) the boundary problem (distinguishing beneficial cooperation from harmful collusion) and adversarial adaptation (agents learning to evade detection).

Abstract: In this work, we provide a simple yet tight analytical approximation of the packet loss rate in the error floor region for a non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)-based irregular repetition slotted ALOHA (IRSA) scheme. Considering an Internet of Things (IoT) scenario, users randomly select both the number of replicas based on a designed degree distribution and the transmission power from predetermined levels, while successive interference cancellation (SIC) is performed at the receiver. Our derived packet loss rate expression in the finite length regime is promptly evaluated. Its accuracy is validated through Monte-Carlo simulations, demonstrating a strong match across channel loads, including those beyond the low load regime

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We evaluate a modification of irregular repetition slotted ALOHA (IRSA) involving intermediate decoding and early transmission termination by some nodes, upon their decoding success. This is meant to avoid unnecessary transmissions, thereby reducing energy consumption. We expect this to be particularly useful at low loads, where most transmissions can be avoided as they do not often result in a collision and are therefore redundant. To validate this proposal, we observe that most of the literature related to IRSA considers an asymptotic heavily loaded regime; thus, we also present a model of energy consumption and success probability for frames of limited length and low offered loads. Thanks to our analysis, also confirmed by simulation, we are able to show that the proposed technique is able to reduce IRSA energy consumption by minimizing transmissions, while preserving performance gains over standard ALOHA. For example, we are able to get a 33% energy saving at offered loads around 10% without affecting throughput.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Differentiable rendering is a technique that aims to invert the rendering process to enable optimizing rendering parameters from a set of images. In this article, we present a differentiable volume rendering solution called DiffTetVR for tetrahedral meshes. Unlike previous works based on regular grids, this enables the optimization of vertex positions and the local subdivision of the mesh without relying on multigrid methods. We present an efficient implementation of the forward rendering process, deduce the derivatives for the backwards pass and regularization terms for avoiding degenerate tetrahedra, and finally show how the tetrahedral mesh can be subdivided locally to enable a coarse-to-fine optimization process. The source code is made publicly available on GitHub at https://github.com/chrismile/DiffTetVR.

Abstract: We propose a novel computational framework for modeling and simulating origami structures. In this framework, bilinear solid-shell elements are employed to model the origami panels while crease folding is considered through the angle between the director vectors of the adjacent panels. The director vector is the vector normal to the mid-surface before displacement/deformation comes in. To mitigate locking issues in the solid-shell element, we introduce the assumed natural strain method. To validate the effectiveness of our framework, we conduct origami simulations involving both straight- and curved-creases. The accuracy and efficacy of the framework are demonstrated through quantitative and qualitative analyses.
