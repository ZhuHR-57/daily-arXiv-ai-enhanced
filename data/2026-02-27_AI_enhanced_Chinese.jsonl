To address these challenges, we developed VoiceAlign, an adaptive shimming layer that mediates between users and legacy VUI systems. VoiceAlign intercepts natural voice commands, transforms them to match the required syntax using a large language model, and transmits these adapted commands through a virtual audio channel that remains transparent to the underlying system. In our evaluation with 12 participants, VoiceAlign reduced command failures by half, required 25% fewer commands per task, and significantly lowered cognitive and temporal demands when paired with an existing legacy VUI system. Furthermore, we created a synthetic dataset informed by our studies and fine-tuned a small language model that achieves over 90% accuracy with 200 ms response time when served locally, eliminating dependence on third-party APIs while enabling real-time interaction on edge devices.

However, these sensors usually exhibit non-linear and cross-reactive behavior, contrary to the idealizing assumption of linear and perfectly molecule type-specific sensing often made in the MC literature. To address this mismatch, we propose several detectors and transmission schemes for a molecule mixture communication system where the receiver (RX) employs non-linear, cross-reactive sensors. All proposed schemes are based on the first- and second-order moments of the symbol likelihoods that are fed through the non-linear RX using the Unscented Transform. In particular, we propose an approximate maximum likelihood (AML) symbol-by-symbol detector for inter-symbol-interference (ISI)-free transmission scenarios and a complementary mixture alphabet design algorithm which accounts for the RX characteristics. When significant ISI is present at high data rates, the AML detector can be adapted to exploit statistical ISI knowledge. Additionally, we propose a sequence detector which combines information from multiple symbol intervals. For settings where sequence detection is not possible due to extremely limited computational power at the RX, we propose an adaptive transmission scheme which can be combined with symbol-by-symbol detection. Using computer simulations, we validate all proposed detectors and algorithms based on the responses of commercially available sensors as well as artificially generated sensor data incorporating the characteristics of metal-oxide semiconductor sensors.

We present TopoEdit, a fast post-optimization editor that demonstrates how structured latent embeddings from a pre-trained topology foundation model (OAT) can be repurposed as an interface for physics-aware engineering edits. Given an optimized topology, TopoEdit encodes it into OAT's spatial latent, applies partial noising to preserve instance identity while increasing editability, and injects user intent through an edit-then-denoise diffusion pipeline. We instantiate three edit operators: drag-based topology warping with boundary-condition-consistent conditioning updates, shell-infill lattice replacement using a lattice-anchored reference latent with updated volume-fraction conditioning, and late-stage no-design region enforcement via masked latent overwrite followed by diffusion-based recovery. A consistency-preserving guided DDIM procedure localizes changes while allowing global structural adaptation; multiple candidates can be sampled and selected using a compliance-aware criterion, with optional short SIMP refinement for warps.

To support this, visual analytics systems frequently employ quantitative computational measures to provide automated guidance. However, it remains unclear how well these measures align with subjective human visual perception, thereby offering recommendations that conflict with analysts' intuitive judgments, potentially leading to confusion rather than reducing cognitive load. Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), capable of visually interpreting graphs and explaining their reasoning in natural language, have emerged as a potential alternative to address this challenge. This paper bridges the gap between human and machine assessment of graph similarity through three interconnected experiments using a dataset of 1,881 node-link diagrams. Experiment 1 collects relative similarity judgments and rationales from 32 human participants, revealing consensus on graph similarity while prioritizing global shapes and edge densities over exact topological details. Experiment 2 benchmarks 16 computational measures against these human judgments, identifying Portrait divergence as the best-performing metric, though with only moderate alignment. Experiment 3 evaluates the potential of three state-of-the-art MLLMs (GPT-5, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Claude Sonnet 4.5) as perceptual proxies. The results demonstrate that MLLMs, particularly GPT-5, significantly outperform traditional measures in aligning with human graph similarity perception and provide interpretable rationales for their decisions, whereas Claude Sonnet 4.5 shows the best computational efficiency. Our findings suggest that MLLMs hold significant promise not only as effective, explainable proxies for human perception but also as intelligent guides that can uncover subtle nuances that might be overlooked by human analysts in visual analytics systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Moreover, the entire hybrid structure can be fabricated through a single, seamless process using only a standard FDM printer, including both heat-sealing and 3D and 4D printing. In this paper, we define a design space including four primitive categories that capture the fundamental ways in which printed and pneumatic components can interact.

It proposes a controllable generation framework for dynamic interactive content construction. The framework builds a structured semantic state space that encodes user input, environmental conditions, and historical context into actionable latent representations and generates directional control vectors to guide the content generation process. It introduces multilevel constraints, including semantic consistency constraints, structural stability constraints, and semantic drift penalties, which help the model maintain clear semantic paths and coherent logic in dynamic environments. These constraints prevent content deviation, unstable tone, or structural breaks. Based on these components, the study designs a systematic controllable generation pipeline in which semantic modeling, control signals, and generation strategies work together within one framework. Sensitivity analyses on control vector dimension, hidden layer size, noise intensity, and training sample scale are conducted on a public dialogue dataset to validate the framework. The results show that the approach improves semantic structure, contextual consistency, and controllable expression, providing a structured and effective solution for interactive content generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We introduce TherapyProbe, a design probe methodology that generates actionable design knowledge by systematically exploring chatbot conversation trajectories through adversarial multi-agent simulation.

This tension is exemplified in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), where auditory sensitivities are common yet highly heterogeneous.

We instead propose a constraint-first Input-Envelope-Output (I-E-O) framework that makes safety explicit and verifiable while preserving action-output causality. I-E-O introduces a low-risk envelope layer between user input and audio output to specify safe bounds, enforce them deterministically, and log interventions for audit. From this architecture, we derive four verifiable design principles and instantiate them in MusiBubbles, a web-based prototype.

Small language models (SLMs) offer a potential alternative, but their effectiveness for role classification in HRI has not been systematically evaluated. In this paper, we present a benchmark of SLMs for leader-follower communication, introducing a novel dataset derived from a published database and augmented with synthetic samples to capture interaction-specific dynamics. We investigate two adaptation strategies: prompt engineering and fine-tuning, studied under zero-shot and one-shot interaction modes, compared with an untrained baseline. Experiments with Qwen2.5-0.5B reveal that zero-shot fine-tuning achieves robust classification performance (86.66% accuracy) while maintaining low latency (22.2 ms per sample), significantly outperforming baseline and prompt-engineered approaches. However, results also indicate a performance degradation in one-shot modes, where increased context length challenges the model's architectural capacity.
