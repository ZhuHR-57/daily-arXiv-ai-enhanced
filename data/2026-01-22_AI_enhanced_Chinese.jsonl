However, power-and-area hungry two-step (analog-to-digital and digital-to-stochastic) converters are required for the analog to stochastic signal conversion. To real- ize a one-step conversion, an MTJ device is used as it inherently exhibits a probabilistic switching behavior between two resistance states. Exploiting the device-based probabilistic behavior, analog signals can be directly and area-efficiently converted to stochastic signals to mitigate the signal- conversion overhead. The analog-to-stochastic signal conversion is theoretically described and the conversion characteristic is evaluated using device and circuit parameters. In addition, the resistance variability of the MTJ device is considered in order to compensate the variability effect on the sig- nal conversion. Based on the theoretical analysis, the analog-to-stochastic converter is designed in 90nm CMOS and 100nm MTJ technologies and is verified using a SPICE simulator (NS-SPICE) that handles both transistors and MTJ devices.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Redirected Walking (RDW) techniques mitigate this by subtly manipulating the virtual camera to guide users away from physical collisions within pre-defined VEs. However, RDW efficacy diminishes significantly when substantial geometric divergence exists between the physical and virtual environments, leading to unavoidable collisions. Existing scene generation methods primarily focus on object relationships or layout aesthetics, often neglecting the crucial aspect of physical compatibility required for effective RDW. To address this, we introduce HCVR (High Compatibility Virtual Reality Environment Generation), a novel framework that generates virtual scenes inherently optimized for alignment-based RDW controllers. HCVR first employs ENI++, a novel, boundary-sensitive metric to evaluate the incompatibility between physical and virtual spaces by comparing rotation-sensitive visibility polygons. Guided by the ENI++ compatibility map and user prompts, HCVR utilizes a Large Language Model (LLM) for context-aware 3D asset retrieval and initial layout generation. The framework then strategically adjusts object selection, scaling, and placement to maximize coverage of virtually incompatible regions, effectively guiding users towards RDW-feasible paths. User studies evaluating physical collisions and layout quality demonstrate HCVR's effectiveness with HCVR-generated scenes, resulting in 22.78 times fewer physical collisions and received 35.89\\% less on ENI++ score compared to LLM-based generation with RDW, while also receiving 12.5\\% higher scores on user feedback to layout design.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

These apps commonly support engagement through goals, reminders, and structured targets, which can reinforce comparison, judgment, and performance anxiety. To explore a complementary approach that prioritizes self-reflection, we design KRIYA, an AI wellbeing companion that supports co-interpretive engagement with personal wellbeing data. KRIYA aims to collaborate with users to explore questions, explanations, and future scenarios through features such as Comfort Zone, Detective Mode, and What-If Planning. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 18 college students interacting with a KRIYA prototype using hypothetical data. Our findings show that through KRIYA interaction, users framed engaging with wellbeing data as interpretation rather than performance, experienced reflection as supportive or pressuring depending on emotional framing, and developed trust through transparency. We discuss design implications for AI companions that support curiosity, self-compassion, and reflective sensemaking of personal health data.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In this paper, we investigate the role of behavioral traits as an explicit characterization layer to regulate agents' propensities across posting, re-sharing, commenting, reacting, and inactivity. Through large-scale simulations involving 980 agents and validation against real-world social media data, we demonstrate that behavioral traits are essential to sustain heterogeneous, profile-consistent participation patterns and enable realistic content propagation dynamics through the interplay of amplification- and interaction-oriented profiles.

Using fine-grained behavioral analysis and automated critical thinking assessment, we found that interface design fundamentally alters exploration strategies and evidence integration. While the Hover Card interface facilitated seamless, on-demand verification during the task, the Aligned Sidebar uniquely mitigated the negative effects of information overload: as citation density increased, Sidebar users demonstrated significantly higher critical thinking and synthesis scores compared to other conditions.

However, it remains an enduring challenge, as traditional designer-centric approaches restrict meaningful user participation, while user-driven methods demand design proficiency, often marginalizing professional creative judgment. Current co-design practices, including workshops and AI-assisted frameworks, struggle with low user engagement, inefficient preference collection, and difficulties in balancing user feedback with design considerations. To address these challenges, we conducted a formative study with designers and users experienced in co-design (N=7), identifying critical challenges for current collaboration between designers and users in the co-design process, and their requirements. Informed by these insights, we introduce DesignBridge, a multi-platform AI-enhanced interactive system that bridges designer expertise and user preferences through three stages: (1) Initial Design Framing, where designers define initial concepts. (2) Preference Expression Collection, where users intuitively articulate preferences via interactive tools. (3) Preference-Integrated Design, where designers use AI-assisted analytics to integrate feedback into cohesive designs. A user study demonstrates that DesignBridge significantly enhances user preference collection and analysis, enabling designers to integrate diverse preferences with professional expertise.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We then compare the performance of systems trained on spoken imagined-chart data versus typed existing-chart data, finding that the first system outperforms the second one on both voice and text input, highlighting the necessity of targeted training on spoken imagined-chart data.

Thirty-two licensed drivers completed five secondary tasks while visual and cognitive demands were measured using the Detection Response Task (DRT) for cognitive load, eye-tracking for visual attention, and subjective workload ratings. Results indicated that Gemini Live interactions (both single-turn and multi-turn) and hands-free phone calls shared similar levels of cognitive load, between that of visual turn-by-turn guidance and OSPAN. Exploratory analysis showed that cognitive load remained stable across extended multi-turn conversations. All tasks maintained mean glance durations well below the well-established 2-second safety threshold, confirming low visual demand. Furthermore, drivers consistently dedicated longer glances to the roadway between brief off-road glances toward the device during task completion, particularly during voice-based interactions, rendering longer total-eyes-off-road time findings less consequential. Subjective ratings mirrored objective data, with participants reporting low effort, demands, and perceived distraction for Gemini Live. These findings demonstrate that advanced LLM conversational agents, when implemented via voice interfaces, impose cognitive and visual demands comparable to established, low-risk hands-free benchmarks, supporting their safe deployment in the driving environment.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Yet human judgement remains paramount for high-stakes decision-making. This has fueled explorations of collaborative decision-making between humans and AI systems, aiming to leverage the strengths of both. To explore this dynamic, researchers conduct empirical studies, investigating how humans use AI assistance for decision-making and how this collaboration impacts results. A critical aspect of conducting these studies is the role of participants, often recruited through crowdsourcing platforms. The validity of these studies hinges on the behaviours of the participants, hence effective incentives that can potentially affect these behaviours are a key part of designing and executing these studies. In this work, we aim to address the critical role of incentive design for conducting empirical human-AI decision-making studies, focusing on understanding, designing, and documenting incentive schemes. Through a thematic review of existing research, we explored the current practices, challenges, and opportunities associated with incentive design for human-AI decision-making empirical studies. We identified recurring patterns, or themes, such as what comprises the components of an incentive scheme, how incentive schemes are manipulated by researchers, and the impact they can have on research outcomes. Leveraging the acquired understanding, we curated a set of guidelines to aid researchers in designing effective incentive schemes for their studies, called the Incentive-Tuning Framework, outlining how researchers can undertake, reflect on, and document the incentive design process.
