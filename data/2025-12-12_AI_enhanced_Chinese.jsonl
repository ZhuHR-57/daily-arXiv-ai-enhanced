The application is a multi-dimensional visualization with coordinated 3D and 2D views on a desktop VR system. The input devices are buttonballs with seamless switching between 3D and 2D device modes, as well as between free-hand finger input and device usage. The 3D and 2D device mode switch automatically switches a buttonball's visual representation between a 3D cursor and a 2D cursor while changing the available user interaction techniques between 3D and 2D interaction techniques to interact with the coordinated views.

InFerActive enables on-demand exploration through probability-based filtering and evaluation features, while bridging the semantic gap between computational tokens and human-readable text through adaptive visualization techniques.

To address the limited query-rejection capability of current voice assistants, this paper presents the first Chinese-oriented open-source benchmark and evaluation suite for smart homes, together with a personalized query-rejection method based on large language models. On the data side, we construct the first multimodal query-rejection dataset tailored for domestic scenarios, containing 11,913 manually labeled text-speech pairs that systematically cover twelve typical dialogue types (e.g., chit-chat, non-human sounds, valid commands, ambiguous references, device-irrelevant requests). Fine-grained labels, conversational context and multi-turn information are provided to support both zero-shot and fine-tuning evaluations across language and multimodal large models.

Traditional approaches rely on external sensors or simplify vehicle dynamics, which limits their applicability during agile flight or in resource-constrained platforms.

The approach first estimates external aerodynamic forces using a disturbance observer (DOB), and then maps these forces to wind vectors using a thin-plate spline (TPS) model. A custom-designed wind barrel mounted on the UAV enhances aerodynamic sensitivity, further improving estimation accuracy. The system is validated through comprehensive experiments in wind tunnels, indoor and outdoor flights. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves consistently high-accuracy wind estimation across controlled and real-world conditions, with speed RMSEs as low as \\SI{0.06}{m/s} in wind tunnel tests, \\SI{0.22}{m/s} during outdoor hover, and below \\SI{0.38}{m/s} in indoor and outdoor dynamic flights, and direction RMSEs under \\ang{7.3} across all scenarios, outperforming existing baselines.

Recent dynamic view synthesis methods achieve high-quality rendering but often produce physically implausible motions. We introduce NeHaD, a neural deformation field for dynamic Gaussian Splatting governed by Hamiltonian mechanics. Our key observation is that existing methods using MLPs to predict deformation fields introduce inevitable biases, resulting in unnatural dynamics. By incorporating physics priors, we achieve robust and realistic dynamic scene rendering. Hamiltonian mechanics provides an ideal framework for modeling Gaussian deformation fields due to their shared phase-space structure, where primitives evolve along energy-conserving trajectories. We employ Hamiltonian neural networks to implicitly learn underlying physical laws governing deformation. Meanwhile, we introduce Boltzmann equilibrium decomposition, an energy-aware mechanism that adaptively separates static and dynamic Gaussians based on their spatial-temporal energy states for flexible rendering. To handle real-world dissipation, we employ second-order symplectic integration and local rigidity regularization as physics-informed constraints for robust dynamics modeling. Additionally, we extend NeHaD to adaptive streaming through scale-aware mipmapping and progressive optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NeHaD achieves physically plausible results with a rendering quality-efficiency trade-off. To our knowledge, this is the first exploration leveraging Hamiltonian mechanics for neural Gaussian deformation, enabling physically realistic dynamic scene rendering with streaming capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}
