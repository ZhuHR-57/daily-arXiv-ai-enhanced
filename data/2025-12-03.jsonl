Existing approaches typically follow an inductive paradigm, where researchers train static models on historical data for popularity prediction. However, the UGC propagation is inherently a dynamic process, and static modeling based on historical features fails to capture the complex interactions and nonlinear evolution. In this paper, we propose PopSim, a novel simulation-based paradigm for social media popularity prediction (SMPP). Unlike the inductive paradigm, PopSim leverages the large language models (LLMs)-based multi-agent social network sandbox to simulate UGC propagation dynamics for popularity prediction. Specifically, to effectively model the UGC propagation process in the network, we design a social-mean-field-based agent interaction mechanism, which models the dual-channel and bidirectional individual-population interactions, enhancing agents' global perception and decision-making capabilities. In addition, we propose a multi-source information aggregation module that transforms heterogeneous social metadata into a uniform formulation for LLMs. Finally, propagation dynamics with multimodal information are fused to provide comprehensive popularity prediction. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that SimPop consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, reducing prediction error by an average of 8.82%, offering a new perspective for research on the SMPP task."}

Current MEE works mainly face two challenges: (1) Inadequate extraction framework modeling for handling complex and flexible multimedia event structure; (2) The absence of multimodal-aligned training data for effective knowledge transfer to MEE task. In this work, we propose a Stepwise Schema-Guided Prompting Framework (SSGPF) using Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) as backbone for adaptive structure capturing to solve MEE task. At the initial step of SSGPF, we design Event Type Schema Guided Prompting (ETSGP) for event detection, then we devise Argument Role Schema Guided Prompting (ARSGP) that contains multi-step prompts with text-bridged grounding technique for argument extraction. We construct a weakly-aligned multimodal event labeled dataset based on existing unimodal event annotations, then conduct parameter efficient instruction tuning with LoRA on LLaVA-v1.5-7B under SSGPF. Experiments on the M2E2 benchmark demonstrate that SSGPF significantly outperforms current SOTA baselines by 5.8 percent F1 on event detection and 8.4 percent F1 on argument extraction."}

Material coating is fundamentally different from existing \"material transfer\" methods, which are designed to replace an object's intrinsic material, often overwriting fine details. To address this new task, we construct a large-scale synthetic dataset (110K images) of 3D objects with varied, physically-based coatings, named DataCoat110K. We then propose CoatFusion, a novel architecture that enables this task by conditioning a diffusion model on both a 2D albedo texture and granular, PBR-style parametric controls, including roughness, metalness, transmission, and a key thickness parameter. Experiments and user studies show CoatFusion produces realistic, controllable coatings and significantly outperforms existing material editing and transfer methods on this new task."}

We examined anthropomorphism of a social AI chatbot during collaborative storytelling and asked how children's attributions related to their behavior and prefrontal activation. Children at ages 5-6 (N = 23) completed three storytelling sessions: interacting with (1) an AI chatbot only, (2) a parent only, and (3) the AI and a parent together. After the sessions, children completed an interview assessing anthropomorphism toward both the AI chatbot and the parent. Behavioral engagement was indexed by the conversational turn count (CTC) ratio, and concurrent fNIRS measured oxygenated hemoglobin in bilateral vmPFC and dmPFC regions. Children reported higher anthropomorphism for parents than for the AI chatbot overall, although AI ratings were relatively high for perceptive abilities and epistemic states. Anthropomorphism was not associated with CTC. In the right dmPFC, higher perceptive scores were associated with greater activation during the AI-only condition and with lower activation during the AI+Parent condition. Exploratory analyses indicated that higher dmPFC activation during the AI-only condition correlated with higher end-of-session \"scared\" mood ratings. Findings suggest that stronger perceptive anthropomorphism can be associated with greater brain activation related to interpreting the AI's mental states, whereas parent co-presence may help some children interpret and regulate novel AI interactions. These results may have design implications for encouraging parent-AI co-use in early childhood."}

Our DMAS features a decentralized agent runtime underpinned by a blockchain-based architecture.

Our performance analysis validates the DMAS as a scalable and efficient solution for building trustworthy multi-agent systems."}

Most current governance practices still rely on single-agent safety containment, prompts, fine-tuning, and moderation layers that constrain individual model behavior but leave the dynamics of multi-model interaction ungoverned. These mechanisms assume a dyadic setting: one model responding to one user under stable oversight. Yet research and industrial development are rapidly shifting toward LLM-to-LLM ecosystems, where outputs are recursively reused as inputs across chains of agents. In such systems, local compliance can aggregate into collective failure even when every model is individually aligned. We propose a conceptual transition from model-level safety to system-level safety, introducing the framework of the Emergent Systemic Risk Horizon (ESRH) to formalize how instability arises from interaction structure rather than from isolated misbehavior. The paper contributes (i) a theoretical account of collective risk in interacting LLMs, (ii) a taxonomy connecting micro, meso, and macro-level failure modes, and (iii) a design proposal for InstitutionalAI, an architecture for embedding adaptive oversight within multi-agent systems."}

Unlike physical robots, XR-native agents are unbound by hardware constraints and can be instantiated, adapted, and scaled on demand, while still affording embodiment and co-presence. We synthesize work across XR, HRI, and cognitive AI to show how such agents can support safety-critical scenarios, socially and cognitively empathic interaction across domains, and outreaching physical capabilities with XR and AI integration. We then discuss how multimodal large FMs (e.g., large language model, large vision model, and vision-language model) enable context-aware reasoning, affect-sensitive situations, and long-term adaptation, positioning virtual robots as cognitive and empathic mediators rather than mere simulation assets. At the same time, we highlight challenges and potential risks, including overtrust, cultural and representational bias, privacy concerns around biometric sensing, and data governance and transparency. The paper concludes by outlining a research agenda for human-centered, ethically grounded XR agents - emphasizing multi-layered evaluation frameworks, multi-user ecosystems, mixed virtual-physical embodiment, and societal and ethical design practices to envision XR-based virtual agents powered by FMs as reshaping future HRI into a more efficient and adaptive paradigm."}

Building a strong digital therapeutic alliance has been proposed to address these barriers. This study highlights the need for a conversational therapeutic companion agent (TCA)-based intervention design. Objective: This study aimed to develop a Wizard-of-Oz TCA-centered prototype integrating social-support-based ecological momentary assessment (EMA), ecological momentary intervention (EMI), behavioral activation, and gamification. We evaluated the six-week proof-of-concept efficacy of this intervention among young adults with depressive symptoms. Methods: Korean young adults aged 20--39 years with mild-to-moderate depressive symptoms (PHQ-9) were recruited online. The intervention group ($n = 29$) received a six-week TCA-based digital intervention, while the control group ($n = 29$), recruited four weeks later, continued their usual routines. The TCA guided four daily behavioral-activation tasks, three mood assessments, meditation, daily summaries, and weekly mission feedback. Both groups were assessed at baseline and at weeks 2, 4, and 6 using the BDI-II, GAD-7, and Q-LES-Q-SF. Results: Of 58 participants, 57 completed the study (one dropout in the intervention group). At week 6, the intervention group showed significantly greater reductions in depressive symptoms and improvements in quality of life than controls. Adherence was 78\\% for EMA, 51\\% for EMI, and 65\\% for daily routines. Conclusions: The TCA-based digital intervention improved depressive symptoms and quality of life with adherence levels comparable to previous digital health interventions. Future studies should refine the TCA design and conduct larger-scale evaluations."}

Research suggests that transparency and interpretability of computational methods tend to increase human acceptance of using AI to support decisions. However, the extent to which humans accept AI judgments for deception detection remains unclear. We experimentally examined how an AI model's accuracy (i.e., its overall performance in deception detection) and confidence (i.e., the model's uncertainty in single-statements predictions) influence human adoption of the model's judgments. Participants (n=373) were presented with veracity judgments of an AI model with high or low overall accuracy and various degrees of prediction confidence. The results showed that humans followed predictions from a highly accurate model more than from a less accurate one. Interestingly, the more confident the model, the more people deviated from it, especially if the model predicted deception. We also found that human interaction with algorithmic predictions either worsened the machine's performance or was ineffective. While this human aversion to accept highly confident algorithmic predictions was partly explained by participants' tendency to overestimate humans' deception detection abilities, we also discuss how truth-default theory and the social costs of accusing someone of lying help explain the findings."}

Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) enable the generation of synthetic participant data by prompting models to answer items while impersonating individuals of specific demographic profiles, potentially allowing in silico piloting before real data collection. Across four preregistered studies (N = circa 300 each), we tested whether LLM-simulated datasets can reproduce the latent structures and measurement properties of human responses. In Studies 1-2, we compared LLM-generated data with real datasets for two validated scales; in Studies 3-4, we created new scales using EFA on simulated data and then examined whether these structures generalized to newly collected human samples. Simulated datasets replicated the intended factor structures in three of four studies and showed consistent configural and metric invariance, with scalar invariance achieved for the two newly developed scales. However, correlation-based tests revealed substantial differences between real and synthetic datasets, and notable discrepancies appeared in score distributions and variances. Thus, while LLMs capture group-level latent structures, they do not approximate individual-level data properties. Simulated datasets also showed full internal invariance across gender. Overall, LLM-generated data appear useful for early-stage, group-level psychometric prototyping, but not as substitutes for individual-level validation. We discuss methodological limitations, risks of bias and data pollution, and ethical considerations related to in silico psychometric simulations."}
