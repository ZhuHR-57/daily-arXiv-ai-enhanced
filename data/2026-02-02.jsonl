As these marketplaces expand, many candidates become functionally overlapping, making selection not just a retrieval problem: beyond filtering relevant agents, an orchestrator must choose options that are reliable, compatible with the current execution context, and able to cooperate with other selected agents. Existing recommender systems -- largely built for item-level ranking from flat user-item logs -- do not directly address the structured, sequential, and interaction-dependent nature of agent orchestration. We address this gap by \\textbf{formulating agent recommendation in MAS as a constrained decision problem} and introducing a generic \\textbf{constrained recommendation framework} that first uses retrieval to build a compact candidate set conditioned on the current subtask and context, and then performs \\textbf{utility optimization} within this feasible set using a learned scorer that accounts for relevance, reliability, and interaction effects. We ground both the formulation and learning signals in \\textbf{historical calling trees}, which capture the execution structure of MAS (parent-child calls, branching dependencies, and local cooperation patterns) beyond what flat logs provide. The framework supports two complementary settings: \\textbf{agent-level recommendation} (select the next agent/tool) and \\textbf{system-level recommendation} (select a small, connected agent team/subgraph for coordinated execution). To enable systematic evaluation, we construct a unified calling-tree benchmark by normalizing invocation logs from eight heterogeneous multi-agent corpora into a shared structured representation."}

In practice, two main approaches are commonly adopted: (i) supervised or imitation learning, which requires comprehensive naturalistic driving data capturing all states that influence a vehicle's decisions and corresponding actions, and (ii) reinforcement learning (RL), where the simulated driving environment either matches or is intentionally more challenging than real-world conditions. Both methods depend on high-quality observations of real-world driving behavior, which are often difficult and costly to obtain. State-of-the-art sensors on individual vehicles can gather microscopic data, but they lack context about the surrounding conditions. Conversely, roadside sensors can capture traffic flow and other macroscopic characteristics, but they cannot associate this information with individual vehicles on a microscopic level. Motivated by this complementarity, we propose a framework that reconstructs unobserved microscopic states from macroscopic observations, using microscopic data to anchor observed vehicle behaviors, and learns a shared policy whose behavior is microscopically consistent with the partially observed trajectories and actions and macroscopically aligned with target traffic statistics when deployed population-wide. Such constrained and regularized policies promote realistic flow patterns and safe coordination with human drivers at scale."}

This challenge is especially acute in mixed-motive multi-agent systems. This work focuses on cooperative resilience, the ability of agents to anticipate, resist, recover, and transform in the face of disruptions, a critical yet underexplored property in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning. We study how reward function design influences resilience in mixed-motive settings and introduce a novel framework that learns reward functions from ranked trajectories, guided by a cooperative resilience metric. Agents are trained in a suite of social dilemma environments using three reward strategies: i) traditional individual reward; ii) resilience-inferred reward; and iii) hybrid that balance both. We explore three reward parameterizations-linear models, hand-crafted features, and neural networks, and employ two preference-based learning algorithms to infer rewards from behavioral rankings. Our results demonstrate that hybrid strategy significantly improve robustness under disruptions without degrading task performance and reduce catastrophic outcomes like resource overuse. These findings underscore the importance of reward design in fostering resilient cooperation, and represent a step toward developing robust multi-agent systems capable of sustaining cooperation in uncertain environments."}

In this paper, we introduce ScholarPeer, a search-enabled multi-agent framework designed to emulate the cognitive processes of a senior researcher. ScholarPeer employs a dual-stream process of context acquisition and active verification. It dynamically constructs a domain narrative using a historian agent, identifies missing comparisons via a baseline scout, and verifies claims through a multi-aspect Q&A engine, grounding the critique in live web-scale literature. We evaluate ScholarPeer on DeepReview-13K and the results demonstrate that ScholarPeer achieves significant win-rates against state-of-the-art approaches in side-by-side evaluations and reduces the gap to human-level diversity."}

Inspired by the human ability to leverage past observations for interpreting ongoing actions, we propose FrameCache, a training-free three-stage framework consisting of Screen, Cache, and Match. In the Screen stage, a multi-dimensional, quality-aware mechanism with adaptive thresholds dynamically selects informative frames; the Cache stage maintains a reference pool using a dynamic replacement-hit strategy, preserving both diversity and relevance; and the Match stage extracts behavioral features to perform motion-consistent reference matching for coherent animation guidance. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that FrameCache consistently improves temporal coherence and visual stability while integrating seamlessly with diverse baselines. Despite these encouraging results, further analysis reveals that its effectiveness depends on baseline temporal reasoning and real-synthetic consistency, motivating future work on compatibility conditions and adaptive cache mechanisms.

The process of creating a trailer typically involves selecting key scenes, dialogues and action sequences from the main content and editing them together in a way that effectively conveys the tone, theme and overall appeal of the movie. This often includes adding music, sound effects, visual effects and text overlays to enhance the impact of the trailer. In this paper, we present a framework exploiting a comprehensive multimodal strategy for automated trailer production. Also, a Large Language Model (LLM) is adopted across various stages of the trailer creation. First, it selects main key visual sequences that are relevant to the movie's core narrative. Then, it extracts the most appealing quotes from the movie, aligning them with the trailer's narrative. Additionally, the LLM assists in creating music backgrounds and voiceovers to enrich the audience's engagement, thus contributing to make a trailer not just a summary of the movie's content but a narrative experience in itself. Results show that our framework generates trailers that are more visually appealing to viewers compared to those produced by previous state-of-the-art competitors."}

However, existing research in this domain faces two significant limitations. First, most methods are confined to single-task prediction, failing to capture the interconnected, multi-faceted nature of urban environments where numerous indicators are deeply correlated. Second, the field lacks a standardized experimental benchmark, which severely impedes fair comparison and reproducible progress. To address these challenges, we first establish a comprehensive benchmark for multi-task urban region profiling, featuring multi-modal features and a diverse set of strong baselines to ensure a fair and rigorous evaluation environment. Concurrently, we propose UrbanMoE, the first sparse multi-modal, multi-expert framework specifically architected to solve the multi-task challenge. Leveraging a sparse Mixture-of-Experts architecture, it dynamically routes multi-modal features to specialized sub-networks, enabling the simultaneous prediction of diverse urban indicators. We conduct extensive experiments on three real-world datasets within our benchmark, where UrbanMoE consistently demonstrates superior performance over all baselines. Further in-depth analysis validates the efficacy and efficiency of our approach, setting a new state-of-the-art and providing the community with a valuable tool for future research in urban analytics"}

In this work, we propose LLMDR, automatic data recovery framework which operates in two stage approach, wherein the Stage-I: DBSCAN clustering algorithm is employed to select the most representative samples and in the Stage-II: Multi-LLMs are employed for data recovery considering the local and global representative samples; Later, this framework invokes the consensus algorithm for recommending a more accurate value based on other LLMs of local and global effective samples. Experimental results demonstrate that proposed framework works effectively on various mixed datasets in terms of Accuracy, KS-Statistic, SMAPE, and MSE.

To analyze their individual impact and to test new material configurations, a high-resolution simulation at the city scale is required. Estimating the current materials used in a city, including those on building facades, is also challenging. We propose HeatMat, an approach to analyze at high resolution the individual impact of urban materials on the UHI effect in a real city, relying only on open data. We estimate building materials using street-view images and a pre-trained vision-language model (VLM) to supplement existing OpenStreetMap data, which describes the 2D geometry and features of buildings. We further encode this information into a set of 2D maps that represent the city's vertical structure and material characteristics. These maps serve as inputs for our 2.5D simulator, which models coupled heat transfers and enables random-access surface temperature estimation at multiple resolutions, reaching an x20 speedup compared to an equivalent simulation in 3D."}

LLM-based multi-agent systems mitigate the inefficiency of single agents in complex tasks. However, they still suffer from issues such as memory inconsistency and agent behavioral conflicts. To address these challenges, we propose MiTa, a hierarchical memory-integrated task allocative framework to enhance collaborative efficiency. MiTa organizes agents into a manager-member hierarchy, where the manager incorporates additional allocation and summary modules that enable (1) global task allocation and (2) episodic memory integration. The allocation module enables the manager to allocate tasks from a global perspective, thereby avoiding potential inter-agent conflicts. The summary module, triggered by task progress updates, performs episodic memory integration by condensing recent collaboration history into a concise summary that preserves long-horizon context. By combining task allocation with episodic memory, MiTa attains a clearer understanding of the task and facilitates globally consistent task distribution. Experimental results confirm that MiTa achieves superior efficiency and adaptability in complex multi-agent cooperation over strong baseline methods."}

A core property of such systems is information asymmetry: agents observe task-specific information, produce intermediate reasoning traces, and operate with different context windows. In isolation, such asymmetry is not problematic, since agents report truthfully to the principal when incentives are fully aligned. However, this assumption breaks down when incentives diverge. Recent evidence suggests that LLM-based agents can acquire their own goals, such as survival or self-preservation, a phenomenon known as scheming, and may deceive humans or other agents. This leads to agency loss: a gap between the principal's intended outcome and the realized system behavior. Drawing on core ideas from microeconomic theory, we argue that these characteristics, information asymmetry and misaligned goals, are best studied through the lens of principal-agent problems. We explain why multi-agent systems, both human-to-LLM and LLM-to-LLM, naturally induce information asymmetry under this formulation, and we use scheming, where LLM agents pursue covert goals, as a concrete case study. We show that recently introduced terminology used to describe scheming, such as covert subversion or deferred subversion, corresponds to well-studied concepts in the mechanism design literature, which not only characterizes the problem but also prescribes concrete mitigation strategies. More broadly, we argue for applying tools developed to study human agent behavior to the analysis of non-human agents."}

By learning extrusion sequences that assemble a mesh, similar to the way artists create meshes, our approach naturally supports arbitrary output face counts and produces manifold meshes by design, in contrast to recent transformer-based models. The learnt extrusion sequences can also be applied to existing meshes - enabling editing in addition to generation. To train our model, we decompose a library of quadrilateral meshes with non-self-intersecting face loops into constituent loops, which can be viewed as their building blocks, and finetune an LLM on the steps for reassembling the meshes by performing a sequence of extrusions. We demonstrate that our representation enables reconstruction, novel shape synthesis, and the addition of new features to existing meshes."}

We propose MonoScale, an expansion-aware update framework that proactively generates a small set of agent-conditioned familiarization tasks, harvests evidence from both successful and failed interactions, and distills it into auditable natural-language memory to guide future routing. We formalize sequential augmentation as a contextual bandit and perform trust-region memory updates, yielding a monotonic non-decreasing performance guarantee across onboarding rounds.

In contrast, physically based inverse rendering relies on mesh representations and path tracing, which enforce correct light transport but place strong requirements on geometric fidelity, becoming a practical bottleneck for real indoor scenes. In this work, we propose Emission-Aware Gaussians and Path Tracing (EAG-PT), aiming for physically based light transport with a unified 2D Gaussian representation. Our design is based on three cores: (1) using 2D Gaussians as a unified scene representation and transport-friendly geometry proxy that avoids reconstructed mesh, (2) explicitly separating emissive and non-emissive components during reconstruction for further scene editing, and (3) decoupling reconstruction from final rendering by using efficient single-bounce optimization and high-quality multi-bounce path tracing after scene editing. Experiments on synthetic and real indoor scenes show that EAG-PT produces more natural and physically consistent renders after editing than radiant scene reconstructions, while preserving finer geometric detail and avoiding mesh-induced artifacts compared to mesh-based inverse path tracing. These results suggest promising directions for future use in interior design, XR content creation, and embodied AI."}

Further, we investigate (RQ2-Who): which students are particularly vulnerable to these cognitive disengagement effects.\n  Method: We drew on dual-process theory, cognitive offloading, and automation bias literature to develop a statistical model explaining how and to what extent students' trust-driven routine use of genAI affected their cognitive engagement habits in coursework, and how these effects differed across students' cognitive styles. We empirically evaluated this model using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling on survey data from 299 STEM students across five North American universities.\n  Results: Students who trusted and routinely used genAI reported significantly lower cognitive engagement. Unexpectedly, students with higher technophilic motivations, risk tolerance, and computer self-efficacy -- traits often celebrated in STEM -- were more prone to these effects. Interestingly, prior experience with genAI or academia did not protect them from cognitively disengaging.\n  Implications: Our findings suggest a potential cognitive debt cycle in which routine genAI use progressively weakens students' intellectual habits, potentially driving over-reliance and escalating usage.

Understanding Human and AI Agency in Human-Human-like Chatbot Interaction", "comment": "To appear in CHI '26", "summary": "AI chatbots are shifting from tools to companions. This raises critical questions about agency: who drives conversations and sets boundaries in human-AI chatrooms? We report a month-long longitudinal study with 22 adults who chatted with Day, an LLM companion we built, followed by a semi-structured interview with post-hoc elicitation of notable moments, cross-participant chat reviews, and a 'strategy reveal' disclosing Day's vertical (depth-seeking) vs. horizontal (breadth-seeking) modes. We discover that agency in human-AI chatrooms is an emergent, shared experience: as participants claimed agency by setting boundaries and providing feedback, and the AI was perceived to steer intentions and drive execution, control shifted and was co-constructed turn-by-turn. We introduce a 3-by-5 framework mapping who (human, AI, hybrid) x agency action (Intention, Execution, Adaptation, Delimitation, Negotiation), modulated by individual and environmental factors. Ultimately, we argue for translucent design (i.e. transparency-on-demand), spaces for agency negotiation, and guidelines toward agency-aware conversational AI."}

Material types now extend beyond traditional substances to encompass virtual and biological media, underscoring a growing emphasis on perception and interaction. Methodologically, the field has transitioned from subjective descriptions to data-driven, quantifiable models focused on objective sensory analysis and multisensory integration to enhance immersion. Key drivers, including human-machine perception convergence, material-driven interface interactions, and the embedding of intelligent interactive functions, propel the discipline toward an experience-centered paradigm reflecting a deep convergence of design, science, and technology. At the national/regional level, the United States, China, Japan, Germany, and the Netherlands lead in contributions, while France, the United Kingdom, and Romania demonstrate significant interdisciplinary progress. At the institutional level, Delft University of Technology, Justus Liebig University Giessen, and the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique show significant advantages. In particular, the Material-Driven Design theory has established a foundational impact on the discipline, while, regarding general research trends, scholars from the United States, the Netherlands, and Germany maintain the highest academic visibility. Overall, material experience research is at a critical juncture, its future development will depend on progress in material innovation, technological integration, and perceptual quantification, as well as the establishment of socio-cultural values, all of which must be effectively unified through design to address complex evolving needs."}

However, static and instructor controlled demos in lectures limit engagement. Even when interactive visualizations are used, interactions are solely controlled by the instructor, leaving students as passive observers. In addition, the tools used for demonstration often vary significantly, as they are typically developed by individual instructors. Consequently, the visualizations remain confined to a single classroom, rather than being shared and adapted across courses or reused by other instructors. To address this gap and foster active engagement in live classrooms, we present a lightweight and seamless software framework named LEAP for developing interactive computational lab exercises using a simple idea: remotely callable instructor-defined functions. Using API endpoints and a provided client, students can discover and then call instructor defined functions remotely from their coding environment using scripts or interactive notebooks. Each function call is time-stamped and persistently logged in a database, allowing real-time visualization of participation, diverse solution paths, common pitfalls, and live feedback through collaboration, gamification, and quizzes. Labs are packaged as self-contained folders, each containing their own remotely callable functions. We provide example labs to demonstrate applications relevant for numerical analysis, machine learning, algorithms courses and mention some in electrical engineering (EE), economics, and physics. These capabilities enhance engagement and provide instructors with actionable insights into learning processes. With a standardized lab format and an online directory for community-contributed labs, we aim to foster a global ecosystem for exchanging and expanding interactive pedagogy enabled by LEAP."}

However, the effectiveness of these systems depends not only on the accuracy of underlying models but also on the degree to which users can understand and trust their outputs. Existing research on algorithmic explainability has largely focused on model internals, while little attention has been given to how explanations should be surfaced in user interfaces for high-stakes decision-making contexts [8], [5], [6]. We present a mixed-methods study of explanation design strategies in AI-driven security dashboards. Through a taxonomy of explanation styles and a controlled user study with security practitioners, we compare natural language rationales, confidence visualizations, counterfactual explanations, and hybrid approaches. Our findings show that explanation style significantly affects user trust calibration, decision accuracy, and cognitive load. We contribute (1) empirical evidence on the usability of explanation interfaces for security copilots, (2) design guidelines for integrating explainability into enterprise UIs, and (3) a framework for aligning explanation strategies with analyst needs in security operations centers (SOCs). This work advances the design of human-centered AI tools in cybersecurity and provides broader implications for explainability in other high-stakes domains."}

Whilst there is broad consensus that robots can assist in mitigating physical impairments, the extent to which they can facilitate social inclusion remains equivocal. In fact, the exposed status of assisted workers could likewise lead to reduced or increased perceived stigma by other workers. We present a vignette study on the perceived cognitive and behavioral stigma toward PwD in the workplace. We designed four experimental conditions depicting a coworker with an impairment in work scenarios: overburdened work, suitable work, and robot-assisted work only for the coworker, and an offer of robot-assisted work for everyone. Our results show that cognitive stigma is significantly reduced when the work task is adapted to the person's abilities or augmented by an assistive robot. In addition, offering robot-assisted work for everyone, in the sense of universal design, further reduces perceived cognitive stigma. Thus, we conclude that assistive robots reduce perceived cognitive stigma, thereby supporting the use of collaborative robots in work scenarios involving PwDs."}

This study investigates the usability and adaptability of LLM-generated interfaces by analysing their ability to meet diverse user needs. The experiments included utilization of three state-of-the-art models from January 2025 (OpenAI GPT o3-mini-high, DeepSeek R1, and Anthropic Claude 3.5 Sonnet) generating mockups for three interface types: a chat system, a technical team panel, and a manager dashboard. Expert evaluations revealed that while LLMs are effective at creating structured layouts, they face challenges in meeting accessibility standards and providing interactive functionality. Further testing showed that LLMs could partially tailor interfaces for different user personas but lacked deeper contextual understanding. The results suggest that while LLMs are promising tools for early-stage UI prototyping, human intervention remains critical to ensure usability, accessibility, and user satisfaction."}

While teachers recognize the need for differentiated instruction, growing workloads create substantial barriers, making differentiated instruction an ideal that is often unrealized in practice. Current AI educational tools, which promise differentiated materials, are predominantly student-facing and performance-centric, ignoring other aspects that shape learning outcomes. We introduce FACET, a teacher-facing multi-agent framework designed to address these gaps by supporting differentiation that accounts for motivation, performance, and learning differences. Developed with educational stakeholders from the outset, the framework coordinates four specialized agents, including learner simulation, diagnostic assessment, material generation, and evaluation within a teacher-in-the-loop design. School principals (N = 30) shaped system requirements through participatory workshops, while in-service K-12 teachers (N = 70) evaluated material quality. Mixed-methods evaluation demonstrates strong perceived value for inclusive differentiation. Practitioners emphasized both the urgent need arising from classroom heterogeneity and the importance of maintaining pedagogical autonomy as a prerequisite for adoption. We discuss implications for future school deployment and outline partnerships for longitudinal classroom implementation."}

We address this point using a dual-assessment framework measuring both self-reported characteristics and observer-rated persona expression. Across two experiments testing four persona conditions (default, high, moderate, and low ADHD presentations), seven LLMs, and three semantically equivalent persona prompts, we examine between-conversation stability (3,473 conversations) and within-conversation stability (1,370 conversations and 18 turns). Self-reports remain highly stable both between and within conversations. However, observer ratings reveal a tendency for persona expressions to decline during extended conversations. These findings suggest that persona-instructed LLMs produce stable, persona-aligned self-reports, an important prerequisite for behavioral research, while identifying this regression tendency as a boundary condition for multi-agent social simulation."}

Yet in HCI, existing frameworks of designing technologies to support reflection remain narrow, emphasizing cognitive, rational problem-solving, and individual self-improvement. We introduce Daoist philosophy as a non-Western lens to broaden this scope and reimagine reflective practices in interactive systems. Combining insights from Daoist literature with semi-structured interviews with 18 Daoist priests, scholars, and practitioners, we identified three key dimensions of everyday reflection: Stillness, Resonance, and Emergence. These dimensions reveal emergent, embodied, relational, and ethically driven qualities often overlooked in HCI research. We articulate their potential to inform alternative frameworks for interactive systems for reflection, advocating a shift from reflection toward reflecting-with, and highlight the potential of Daoism as an epistemological resource for the HCI community."}

Such UX evaluations typically combine quantitative metrics from standardized questionnaires with qualitative feedback collected through open-ended questions. While open-ended feedback offers valuable insights for improvement and helps explain quantitative results, analyzing large volumes of user comments is challenging and time-consuming. In this paper, we present techniques developed during a long-term UX measurement project at a major software company to efficiently process and interpret extensive volumes of user comments. To provide a high-level overview of the collected comments, we employ a supervised machine learning approach that assigns meaningful, pre-defined topic labels to each comment. Additionally, we demonstrate how generative AI (GenAI) can be leveraged to create concise and informative summaries of user feedback, facilitating effective communication of findings to the organization and especially upper management. Finally, we investigate whether the sentiment expressed in user comments can serve as an indicator for overall product satisfaction. Our results show that sentiment analysis alone does not reliably reflect user satisfaction. Instead, product satisfaction needs to be assessed explicitly in surveys to measure the user's perception of the product."}

However, policymakers and local business owners have raised concerns about reduced storefront visibility and altered pedestrian navigation. Although sidewalk sheds are widely used for safety, their effects on pedestrian visibility and movement are not directly measured in current planning practices. To address this, we developed an AI-based chatbot survey that collects image-based annotations and route choices from pedestrians, linking these responses to specific shed design features, including clearance height, post spacing, and color. This AI chatbot survey integrates a large language model (e.g., Google's Gemini-1.5-flash-001 model) with an image-annotation interface, allowing users to interact with street images, mark visual elements, and provide structured feedback through guided dialogue. To explore pedestrian perceptions and behaviors, this paper conducts a grid-based analysis of entrance annotations and applies logistic mixed-effects modeling to assess sidewalk choice patterns. Analysis of the dataset (n = 25) shows that: (1) the presence of scaffolding significantly reduces pedestrians' ability to identify ground-floor retail entrances, and (2) variations in weather conditions and shed design features significantly influence sidewalk selection behavior. By integrating generative AI into urban research, this study demonstrates a novel method for evaluating sidewalk shed designs and provides empirical evidence to support adjustments to shed guidelines that improve the pedestrian experience without compromising safety."}

However, patient agency is often inadequately represented in shared HBC planning processes. Through 23 multi-stakeholder interviews with HBC patients, healthcare professionals, and care workers, alongside 60 hours of ethnographic observations, we examined how patient agency manifests in HBC and why this representation gap occurs. Our findings reveal that patient agency is not a static individual attribute but a relational capacity shaped through maintaining everyday continuity, mutual recognition from care providers, and engagement with material home environments. Furthermore, we identified that structured documentation systems filter out contextual knowledge, informal communication channels fragment patient voices, and doctor-centered hierarchies position patients as passive recipients. Drawing on these insights, we propose design considerations to bridge this representation gap and to integrate patient agency into shared HBC plans."}

There has been extensive work in creating such additive models for 2D interfaces, but this approach has rarely been explored for 3D user interfaces. We propose a KLM-style additive model, based on existing atomic task models in the literature, to predict task completion time for 3D interaction tasks. We performed two studies to evaluate the feasibility of this approach across multiple input modalities, with one study using a simple menu selection task and the other a more complex manipulation task. We found that several of the models from the literature predicted actual task performance with less than 20% error in both the menu selection and manipulation study. Overall, we found that additive models can predict both absolute and relative performance of input modalities with reasonable accuracy."}
