To address this issue, we propose a Tri-Dynamic Preprocessing framework for UGC. Firstly, we employ an adaptive factor to regulate preprocessing intensity. Secondly, an adaptive quantization level is employed to fine-tune the codec simulator. Thirdly, we utilize an adaptive lambda tradeoff to adjust the rate-distortion loss function.

Artificial networks typically replicate this via recurrent or parallel architectures, yet incur high energy costs and noise sensitivity. Here we report IPNet, a hardware-software co-designed neuromorphic architecture realizing human-like working memory via neuronal intrinsic plasticity. Exploiting Joule-heating dynamics of Magnetic Tunnel Junctions (MTJs), IPNet physically emulates biological memory volatility. The memory behavior of the proposed architecture shows similar trends in n-back, free recall and memory interference tasks to that of reported human subjects. Implemented exclusively with MTJ neurons, the architecture with human-like working memory achieves 99.65% accuracy on 11-class DVS gesture datasets and maintains 99.48% on a novel 22-class time-reversed benchmark, outperforming RNN, LSTM, and 2+1D CNN baselines sharing identical backbones. For autonomous driving (DDD-20), IPNet reduces steering prediction error by 14.4% compared to ResNet-LSTM. Architecturally, we identify a 'Memory-at-the-Frontier' effect where performance is maximized at the sensing interface, validating a bio-plausible near-sensor processing paradigm. Crucially, all results rely on raw parameters from fabricated devices without optimization. Hardware-in-the-loop validation confirms the system's physical realizability. Separately, energy analysis reveals a reduction in memory power of 2,874x compared to LSTMs and 90,920x versus parallel 3D-CNNs. This capacitor-free design enables a compact ~1.5um2 footprint (28 nm CMOS): a >20-fold reduction over standard LIF neurons.

To address this issue, we propose Ev-Trust, a strategy-equilibrium trust mechanism grounded in evolutionary game theory. This mechanism integrates direct trust, indirect trust, and expected revenue into a dynamic feedback structure that guides agents' behavioral evolution toward equilibria. Within a decentralized \"Request-Response-Payment-Evaluation\" service framework, Ev-Trust enables agents to adaptively adjust strategies, naturally excluding malicious participants while reinforcing high-quality collaboration. Furthermore, our theoretical derivation based on replicator dynamics equations proves the existence and stability of local evolutionary equilibria. Experimental results indicate that our approach effectively reflects agent trustworthiness in LLM-driven open service interaction scenarios, reduces malicious strategies, and increases collective revenue.

We propose a bin-based illumination model that decouples structure from density to enhance flow and reveal sparse outliers while preserving the original colormap. We introduce a bin-based outlierness metric to rank trajectories. Guided by this ranking, we construct a structural normal map and apply locally-adaptive lighting in the luminance channel to highlight chosen patterns -- from dominant trends to atypical paths -- with acceptable color distortion. Our interactive method enables analysts to prioritize main trends, focus on outliers, or strike a balance between the two.

Generative models have demonstrated promising results in creating full-body nonverbal animations synchronized with speech; however, evaluations using statistical metrics in 2D settings fail to fully capture user-perceived emotions, limiting our understanding of model effectiveness. To address this, we evaluate emotional 3D animation generative models within a Virtual Reality (VR) environment, emphasizing user-centric metrics emotional arousal realism, naturalness, enjoyment, diversity, and interaction quality in a real-time human-agent interaction scenario. Through a user study (N=48), we examine perceived emotional quality for three state of the art speech-driven 3D animation methods across two emotions happiness (high arousal) and neutral (mid arousal). Additionally, we compare these generative models against real human expressions obtained via a reconstruction-based method to assess both their strengths and limitations and how closely they replicate real human facial and body expressions. Our results demonstrate that methods explicitly modeling emotions lead to higher recognition accuracy compared to those focusing solely on speech-driven synchrony. Users rated the realism and naturalness of happy animations significantly higher than those of neutral animations, highlighting the limitations of current generative models in handling subtle emotional states. Generative models underperformed compared to reconstruction-based methods in facial expression quality, and all methods received relatively low ratings for animation enjoyment and interaction quality, emphasizing the importance of incorporating user-centric evaluations into generative model development.

This work is an accepted manuscript published in the Elsevier journal \"Journal of Infrastructure Intelligence and Resilience\"", "summary": "Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) has become increasingly critical due to the rapid deterioration of civil infrastructure. Traditional methods involving heavy equipment are costly and time-consuming. Recent SHM approaches use advanced non-contact sensors, IoT, and Augmented Reality (AR) glasses for faster inspections and immersive experiences during inspections. However, current methods lack quantitative damage data, remote collaboration support, and accurate 3D model alignment with the real structure. Recognizing these current challenges, this paper proposes an AR-based system that integrates Building Information Modelling (BIM) visualization and follows a flexible manipulation approach of 3D holograms to improve structural condition assessments. The proposed framework utilizes the Vuforia software development toolkit to enable the automatic alignment of 3D models to the real structure, ensuring successful model alignment to assist users in accurately visualizing damage locations. The framework also enables flexible manipulation of damage locations, making it easier for users to identify multiple damage points in the 3D models. The system is validated through lab-scale and full-scale bridge use cases, with data transfer performance analyzed under 4G and 5G conditions for remote collaboration. This study demonstrates that the proposed AR-based SHM framework successfully aligns 3D models with real structures, allowing users to manually adjust models and damage locations. The experimental results confirm its feasibility for remote collaborative inspections, highlighting significant improvements with 5G networks.

Paralleling this offline model of care, people who seek mental health support from AI chatbots are similarly provided little context for how their expressions of distress are processed by the model, and subsequently, the logic that may underlie model responses. People in severe distress who turn to AI chatbots for support thus find themselves caught between black boxes, with unique forms of agony that arise from these intersecting opacities, including misinterpreting model outputs or attributing greater capabilities to a model than are yet possible, which has led to documented real-world harms. Building on empirical research from clinical psychology and AI safety, alongside rights-oriented frameworks from medical ethics, we describe how the distinct psychological state induced by severe distress can influence chatbot interaction patterns, and argue that this state of mind (combined with differences in how a user might perceive a chatbot compared to a care provider) uniquely necessitates a higher standard of interpretability in comparison to general AI chatbot use. Drawing inspiration from newer interpretable treatment paradigms, we then describe specific technical and interface design approaches that could be used to adapt interpretability strategies from four specific mental health fields (psychotherapy, community-based crisis intervention, psychiatry, and care authorization) to AI models, including consideration of the role of interpretability in the treatment process and tensions that may arise with greater interpretability.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We present HEar-ID, which uses consumer active noise-canceling earbuds to capture low-frequency \"whisper\" audio and high-frequency ultrasonic reflections. Features from both streams pass through a shared encoder, producing embeddings that feed a contrastive branch for user authentication and an SSI head for silent spelling recognition. This design supports decoding of 50 words while reliably rejecting impostors, all on commodity earbuds with a single model. Experiments demonstrate that HEar-ID achieves strong spelling accuracy and robust authentication.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This study examines how different forms of epistemic failure emerge, are masked, and are tolerated in human AI interaction, where failure is understood as a relational breakdown shaped by model-generated plausibility and human interpretive judgment. We conducted a three round, multi LLM evaluation using interdisciplinary tasks and progressively differentiated assessment frameworks to observe how evaluators interpret model responses across linguistic, epistemic, and credibility dimensions. Our findings show that LLM errors shift from predictive to hermeneutic forms, where linguistic fluency, structural coherence, and superficially plausible citations conceal deeper distortions of meaning. Evaluators frequently conflated criteria such as correctness, relevance, bias, groundedness, and consistency, indicating that human judgment collapses analytical distinctions into intuitive heuristics shaped by form and fluency. Across rounds, we observed a systematic verification burden and cognitive drift. As tasks became denser, evaluators increasingly relied on surface cues, allowing erroneous yet well formed answers to pass as credible. These results suggest that error is not solely a property of model behavior but a co-constructed outcome of generative plausibility and human interpretive shortcuts. Understanding AI epistemic failure therefore requires reframing evaluation as a relational interpretive process, where the boundary between system failure and human miscalibration becomes porous. The study provides implications for LLM assessment, digital literacy, and the design of trustworthy human AI communication.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}
