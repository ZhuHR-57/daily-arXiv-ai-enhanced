Abstract: Online proctoring systems (OPS) are technologies and services that are used to monitor students during an online exam to deter cheating. However, OPS often violates student privacy by implementing overly intrusive surveillance to which students cannot consent meaningfully. The technologies used in OPS have been shown to unfairly flag students with disabilities. Our reflexive thematic analysis of interviews with students who have first-hand experience with online invigilated exams and who have disability accommodations points to their anxiety about the interaction between surveillance and their disabilities, leading to fears about misrepresentation and increased cognitive load on the exam. Students describe the compromises they need to make with their privacy and accommodations to take remote tests and share their privacy values. We present the implications for the design of OPS to mitigate the issues faced by disabled students.

Abstract: Multiple-view (MV) visualization provides a comprehensive and integrated perspective on complex data, establishing itself as an effective method for visual communication and exploratory data analysis. While existing studies have predominantly focused on designing explicit visual linkages and coordinated interactions to facilitate the exploration of MV visualizations, these approaches often demand extra graphical and interactive effort, overlooking the potential of color as an effective channel for encoding data and relationships. Addressing this oversight, we introduce C2Views, a new framework for colormap design that implicitly shows the relation across views. We begin by structuring the components and their relationships within MVs into a knowledge-based graph specification, wherein colormaps, data, and views are denoted as entities, and the interactions among them are illustrated as relations. Building on this representation, we formulate the design criteria as an optimization problem and employ a genetic algorithm enhanced by Pareto optimality, generating colormaps that balance single-view effectiveness and multiple-view consistency. Our approach is further complemented with an interactive interface for user-intended refinement. We demonstrate the feasibility of C2Views through various colormap design examples for MVs, underscoring its adaptability to diverse data relationships and view layouts. Comparative user studies indicate that our method outperforms the existing approach in facilitating color distinction and enhancing multiple-view consistency, thereby simplifying data exploration processes.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models have led to Large Reasoning Models, which produce step-by-step reasoning traces. These traces offer insight into how models think and their goals, improving explainability and helping users follow the logic, learn the process, and even debug errors. These traces, however, are often verbose and complex, making them cognitively demanding to comprehend. We address this challenge with ReTrace, an interactive system that structures and visualizes textual reasoning traces to support understanding. We use a validated reasoning taxonomy to produce structured reasoning data and investigate two types of interactive visualizations thereof. In a controlled user study, both visualizations enabled users to comprehend the model's reasoning more accurately and with less perceived effort than a raw text baseline. The results of this study could have design implications for making long and complex machine-generated reasoning processes more usable and transparent, an important step in AI explainability.

Abstract: IoT Trigger-Action Platforms (TAPs) typically offer coarse-grained permission controls. Even when fine-grained controls are available, users are likely overwhelmed by the complexity of setting privacy preferences. This paper contributes to usable privacy management for TAPs by deriving privacy clusters and profiles for different types of users that can be semi-automatically assigned or suggested to them. We developed and validated a questionnaire, based on users' privacy concerns regarding confidentiality and control and their requirements towards transparency in TAPs. In an online study (N=301), where participants were informed about potential privacy risks, we clustered users by their privacy concerns and requirements into Basic, Medium and High Privacy clusters. These clusters were then characterized by the users' data sharing preferences, based on a factorial vignette approach, considering the data categories, the data recipient types, and the purpose of data sharing. Our findings show three distinct privacy profiles, providing a foundation for more usable privacy controls in TAPs.

Abstract: The increasing deployment of autonomous AI agents on the web is hampered by a fundamental misalignment: agents must infer affordances from human-oriented user interfaces, leading to brittle, inefficient, and insecure interactions. To address this, we introduce VOIX, a web-native framework that enables websites to expose reliable, auditable, and privacy-preserving capabilities for AI agents through simple, declarative HTML elements. VOIX introduces <tool> and <context> tags, allowing developers to explicitly define available actions and relevant state, thereby creating a clear, machine-readable contract for agent behavior. This approach shifts control to the website developer while preserving user privacy by disconnecting the conversational interactions from the website. We evaluated the framework's practicality, learnability, and expressiveness in a three-day hackathon study with 16 developers. The results demonstrate that participants, regardless of prior experience, were able to rapidly build diverse and functional agent-enabled web applications. Ultimately, this work provides a foundational mechanism for realizing the Agentic Web, enabling a future of seamless and secure human-AI collaboration on the web.

Abstract: This paper reports a practice-based investigation into authoring responsive light and sound in immersive performance without writing code. A modular system couples live gesture, position, and speech inputs to scenographic outputs through a visual logic layer that performers can operate in rehearsal. Across six workshops with eight professional performance-makers, we staged a progression from parallel ensemble and technical training to integrated dramaturgy, culminating in a single-spectator scratch immersive performance with interactive elements. This paper details the system's building blocks and the workshop arc. A reflexive reading of workshop video logs, post-workshop focus groups, and facilitator notes surfaced three ensemble-level strategies that made the technology workable in a hybrid devising/design practice: rotating roles between operator, performer, and mediator; embracing controlled imperfection as a creative resource; and using technology-describing metaphors to support creative practice.

Abstract: Effective decision-making often relies on timely insights from complex visual data. While Information Visualization (InfoVis) dashboards can support this process, they rarely adapt to users' cognitive state, and less so in real time. We present Symbiotik, an intelligent, context-aware adaptive visualization system that leverages neurophysiological signals to estimate mental workload (MWL) and dynamically adapt visual dashboards using reinforcement learning (RL). Through a user study with 120 participants and three visualization types, we demonstrate that our approach improves task performance and engagement. Symbiotik offers a scalable, real-time adaptation architecture, and a validated methodology for neuroadaptive user interfaces.

Abstract: LLM-based agents are increasingly deployed in multi-agent systems (MAS). As these systems move toward real-world applications, their security becomes paramount. Existing research largely evaluates single-agent security, leaving a critical gap in understanding the vulnerabilities introduced by multi-agent design. However, existing systems fall short due to lack of unified frameworks and metrics focusing on unique rejection modes in MAS. We present SafeAgents, a unified and extensible framework for fine-grained security assessment of MAS. SafeAgents systematically exposes how design choices such as plan construction strategies, inter-agent context sharing, and fallback behaviors affect susceptibility to adversarial prompting. We introduce Dharma, a diagnostic measure that helps identify weak links within multi-agent pipelines. Using SafeAgents, we conduct a comprehensive study across five widely adopted multi-agent architectures (centralized, decentralized, and hybrid variants) on four datasets spanning web tasks, tool use, and code generation. Our findings reveal that common design patterns carry significant vulnerabilities. For example, centralized systems that delegate only atomic instructions to sub-agents obscure harmful objectives, reducing robustness. Our results highlight the need for security-aware design in MAS.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) promise energy-efficient, sparse, biologically inspired computation. Training them with Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) and surrogate gradients achieves strong performance but remains biologically implausible. Equilibrium Propagation (EP) provides a more local and biologically grounded alternative. However, existing EP frameworks, primarily based on deterministic neurons, either require complex mechanisms to handle discontinuities in spiking dynamics or fail to scale beyond simple visual tasks. Inspired by the stochastic nature of biological spiking mechanism and recent hardware trends, we propose a stochastic EP framework that integrates probabilistic spiking neurons into the EP paradigm. This formulation smoothens the optimization landscape, stabilizes training, and enables scalable learning in deep convolutional spiking convergent recurrent neural networks (CRNNs). We provide theoretical guarantees showing that the proposed stochastic EP dynamics approximate deterministic EP under mean-field theory, thereby inheriting its underlying theoretical guarantees. The proposed framework narrows the gap to both BPTT-trained SNNs and EP-trained non-spiking CRNNs in vision benchmarks while preserving locality, highlighting stochastic EP as a promising direction for neuromorphic and on-chip learning.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Audio-Video Large Language Models (AV-LLMs) have enhanced their capabilities in tasks like audio-visual question answering and multimodal dialog systems. Video and audio introduce an extended temporal dimension, resulting in a larger key-value (KV) cache compared to static image embedding. A naive optimization strategy is to selectively focus on and retain KV caches of audio or video based on task. However, in the experiment, we observed that the attention of AV-LLMs to various modalities in the high layers is not strictly dependent on the task. In higher layers, the attention of AV-LLMs shifts more towards the video modality. In addition, we also found that directly integrating temporal KV of audio and spatial-temporal KV of video may lead to information confusion and significant performance degradation of AV-LLMs. If audio and video are processed indiscriminately, it may also lead to excessive compression or reservation of a certain modality, thereby disrupting the alignment between modalities. To address these challenges, we propose AccKV, an Adaptive-Focusing and Cross-Calibration KV cache optimization framework designed specifically for efficient AV-LLMs inference. Our method is based on layer adaptive focusing technology, selectively focusing on key modalities according to the characteristics of different layers, and enhances the recognition of heavy hitter tokens through attention redistribution. In addition, we propose a Cross-Calibration technique that first integrates inefficient KV caches within the audio and video modalities, and then aligns low-priority modalities with high-priority modalities to selectively evict KV cache of low-priority modalities. The experimental results show that AccKV can significantly improve the computational efficiency of AV-LLMs while maintaining accuracy.
