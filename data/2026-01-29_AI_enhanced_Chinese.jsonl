We introduce light field display point rendering (LFDPR), which meets these challenges by improving eye-based point rendering [Gavane and Watson 2023] with texture-based splatting, which avoids oversampling of triangles mapped to only a few texels; and with LFD-biased sampling, which adjusts horizontal and vertical triangle sampling to match the sampling of the LFD itself. To improve image quality, we introduce multiview mipmapping, which reduces texture aliasing even though compute shaders do not support hardware mipmapping. We also introduce angular supersampling and reconstruction to combat LFD view aliasing and crosstalk. The resulting LFDPR is 2-8x times faster than multiview rendering, with similar comparable quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

While most existing methods rely on rasterization to render Gaussians, recent research has started investigating ray tracing approaches to overcome the fundamental limitations inherent in rasterization. However, current Gaussian ray tracing methods suffer from inefficiencies such as bloated acceleration structures and redundant node traversals, which greatly degrade ray tracing performance.\n  In this work, we present GRTX, a set of software and hardware optimizations that enable efficient ray tracing for 3D Gaussian-based rendering. First, we introduce a novel approach for constructing streamlined acceleration structures for Gaussian primitives. Our key insight is that anisotropic Gaussians can be treated as unit spheres through ray space transformations, which substantially reduces BVH size and traversal overhead. Second, we propose dedicated hardware support for traversal checkpointing within ray tracing units. This eliminates redundant node visits during multi-round tracing by resuming traversal from checkpointed nodes rather than restarting from the root node in each subsequent round. Our evaluation shows that GRTX significantly improves ray tracing performance compared to the baseline ray tracing method with a negligible hardware cost.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

IBR-GCS integrates combinatorial maneuver reasoning, trajectory planning, and game-theoretic interaction within a unified framework. The key novelty is a vehicle-specific, strategy-dependent GCS construction. Specifically, at each best-response update, each vehicle builds its own graph conditioned on the current strategies of the other vehicles, with vertices representing lane-specific, time-varying, convex, collision-free regions and edges encoding dynamically feasible transitions. This yields a shortest-path problem in GCS for each best-response step, which admits an efficient convex relaxation that can be solved using convex optimization tools without exhaustive discrete tree search. We then apply an iterative best-response scheme in which vehicles update their trajectories sequentially and provide conditions under which the resulting inexact updates converge to an approximate generalized Nash equilibrium. Simulation results across multi-lane, multi-vehicle scenarios demonstrate that IBR-GCS produces safe trajectories and strategically consistent interactive behaviors.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This paper proposes the first framework for explaining emergent extreme events in multi-agent systems, aiming to answer three fundamental questions: When does the event originate? Who drives it? And what behaviors contribute to it? Specifically, we adapt the Shapley value to faithfully attribute the occurrence of extreme events to each action taken by agents at different time steps, i.e., assigning an attribution score to the action to measure its influence on the event. We then aggregate the attribution scores along the dimensions of time, agent, and behavior to quantify the risk contribution of each dimension. Finally, we design a set of metrics based on these contribution scores to characterize the features of extreme events. Experiments across diverse multi-agent system scenarios (economic, financial, and social) demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework and provide general insights into the emergence of extreme phenomena.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Yet existing approaches often constrain sketches to fixed command tokens or predefined visual forms, overlooking their freeform nature and the central role of humans in shaping intention. To address this, we introduce an interaction paradigm where users convey dynamic intent to a vision-language model via free-form sketching, instantiated here in a sketch storyboard to motion graphics workflow. We implement an interface and improve it through a three-stage study with 24 participants. The study shows how sketches convey motion with minimal input, how their inherent ambiguity requires users to be involved for clarification, and how sketches can visually guide video refinement. Our findings reveal the potential of sketch and AI interaction to bridge the gap between intention and outcome, and demonstrate its applicability to 3D animation and video generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Precise coil placement also directly influences stimulation efficacy. Traditional neuronavigation systems often rely on costly and still hard to use and error-prone tracking systems. To solve these limitations, we present a computer-vision-based neuronavigation system for real-time tracking of patient and TMS instrumentation. The system can feed the necessary data for a digital twin to track TMS stimulation targets. We integrate a self-coordinating optical tracking system with multiple consumer-grade cameras and visible tags with a dynamic 3D brain model in Unity. This model updates in real time to represent the current stimulation coil position and the estimated stimulation point to intuitively visualize neural targets for clinicians. We incorporate an augmented reality (AR) module to bridge the gap between the visualization of the digital twin and the real world and project the brain model in real-time onto the head of a patient. AR headsets or mobile AR devices allow clinicians to interactively view and adjust the placement of the stimulation transducer intuitively instead of guidance through abstract numbers and 6D cross hairs on an external screen. The proposed technique provides improved spatial precision as well as accuracy. A case study with ten participants with a medical background also demonstrates that the system has high usability.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, choosing a style that both lessens psychological reactance (perceived threats to freedom) while simultaneously eliciting feelings of surprise and engagement represents a complex design problem. We explored how three different feedback styles: 'Direct', 'Politeness', and 'Verbal Leakage' (slips or disfluencies to reveal a desired behaviour) affect user perceptions and behavioural intentions. Matching expectations from literature, the 'Direct' chatbot led to lower behavioural intentions and higher reactance, while the 'Politeness' chatbot evoked higher behavioural intentions and lower reactance. However, 'Politeness' was also seen as unsurprising and unengaging by participants. In contrast, 'Verbal Leakage' evoked reactance, yet also elicited higher feelings of surprise, engagement, and humour. These findings highlight that effective feedback requires navigating trade-offs between user reactance and engagement, with novel approaches such as 'Verbal Leakage' offering promising alternative design opportunities.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Despite growing interest in AI tutors, most existing systems are designed for single learners or classroom settings and do not address the distributed planning, coordination, and execution demands of learning at home. This paper introduces ParPal, a human-centred, LLM-powered system that supports multi-actor family learning by decomposing learning goals into actionable subtasks, allocating them across caregivers under realistic availability and expertise constraints, and providing caregiver-in-the-loop tutoring support with visibility into individual and collective contributions. Through expert evaluation of generated weekly learning plans and a one-week field deployment with 11 families, we identify systematic failure modes in current LLM-based planning, including misalignment with role expertise, unnecessary or costly collaboration, missing pedagogical learning trajectories, and physically or temporally infeasible tasks. While ParPal improves coordination clarity and recognition of caregiving effort, these findings expose fundamental limitations in how current LLMs operationalize pedagogical knowledge, reason about collaboration, and account for real-world, embodied constraints. We discuss implications for human-centred AI design and AI methodology, positioning multi-actor family learning as a critical testbed for advancing planning, adaptation, and pedagogical structure in next-generation AI systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

While normative AI literacy frameworks proliferate, empirical understanding of how students actually learn to work with generative AI remains limited.

Drawing on domestication theory and emerging frameworks for AI literacy, we demonstrate that functional AI competence emerges through ongoing relational negotiation rather than one-time adoption. Students develop sophisticated genre portfolios, strategically matching interaction patterns to learning needs while exercising critical judgment about AI limitations. Notably, repair work during AI breakdowns produces substantial learning about AI capabilities, developing what we term \"repair literacy\" -- a crucial but underexplored dimension of AI competence.

With this technique, we cater to the massive datasets and complex multiscale structures in advanced scientific computing, such as cosmological simulations with billions of particles. Effective exploration of such data requires a full 3D understanding of spatial structures, a capability for which immersive environments such as VR are particularly well suited. However, simultaneously supporting global multiscale context and fine-grained local detail remains a significant challenge. A key difficulty lies in dynamically generating continuous density fields from point clouds to facilitate the seamless scale transitions: while KDE is widely used, precomputed fields restrict the accuracy of interaction and omit fine-scale structures, while dynamic computation is often too costly for real-time VR interaction. We address this challenge by leveraging GPU acceleration with k-d-tree-based spatial queries and parallel reduction within a thread group for on-the-fly density estimation. With this approach, we can recalculate scalar fields dynamically as users shift their focus across scales. We demonstrate the benefits of adaptive density estimation through two data exploration tasks: adaptive selection and progressive navigation. Through performance experiments, we demonstrate that ScaleFree with GPU-parallel implementation achieves orders-of-magnitude speedups over sequential and multi-core CPU baselines. In a controlled experiment, we further confirm that our adaptive selection technique improves accuracy and efficiency in multiscale selection tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, one of the key assumptions of RLHF is that the annotators (referred to as workers from here on out) have a homogeneous response space. This assumption is not true in most practical settings and there have been studies done in the past to challenge this notion. This work has been inspired by such studies and explores one of the ways to deal with heterogeneity in worker preferences - by clustering workers with similar preferences and personalising reward models for each cluster. This work provides an algorithm that encourages simultaneous learning of reward models and worker embeddings. This algorithm is then empirically tested against the Reddit TL;DR dataset with unique worker IDs. We have shown that clustering users into different groups based on their preferences and created personalised reward models improves win-rate of the said models. Along with results and visualisations, this work aims to act as a stepping stone to more complicated models and gives a list of possible future extensions.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}
